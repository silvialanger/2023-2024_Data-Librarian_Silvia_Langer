         "description" : "The intensity of the heaviest extreme precipitation events is known to increase with global warming. How often such events occur in a warmer world is however less well established, and the combined effect of changes in frequency and intensity on the total amount of rain falling as extreme precipitation is much less explored, in spite of potentially large societal impacts. Here, we employ observations and climate model simulations to document strong increases in the frequencies of extreme precipitation events occurring on decadal timescales. Based on observations we find that the total precipitation from these intense events almost doubles per degree of warming, mainly due to changes in frequency, while the intensity changes are relatively weak, in accordance to previous studies. This shift towards stronger total precipitation from extreme events is seen in observations and climate models, and increases with the strength \u2013 and hence the rareness \u2013 of the event. Based on these results, we project that if historical trends continue, the most intense precipitation events observed today are likely to almost double in occurrence for each degree of further global warming. Changes to extreme precipitation of this magnitude are dramatically stronger than the more widely communicated changes to global mean precipitation.",

         "description" : "Extratropical cyclones, major contributors to precipitation in the midlatitudes, comprise mesoscale fronts and fine\u2010scale convective storms. Intense oceanic cyclones pose natural hazards, making reliable projections of their changes with global warming of great interest. Here, we analyze the first ever global climate simulations to resolve such mesoscale dynamics of extratropical cyclones. The present\u2010day structure, frequency, and precipitation of the oceanic extratropical cyclones compare well with reanalyses and new satellite datasets that resolve the multiscale cloud\u2010precipitation system. Simulated precipitation from intense oceanic cyclones increases at a rate of 7%/K1, following Clausius\u2010Clapeyron, with warming. The same scaling is apparent also in the interhemispheric contrast, suggesting that the latter could serve as a predictor of the former. Projected changes in precipitation from intense oceanic cyclones with warming may thus be testable using a reliable global observation network of precipitation in the present day.",

         "description" : "Urban populations are expected to increase by 2\u20133 billion by 2050, but we have limited understanding of how future global urban expansion will affect urban heat island (UHI) and hence change the geographic distributions of extreme heat risks. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic global projections of UHI intensification due to urban land expansion through 2050. Our projections show that urban land areas are expected to expand by 0.6\u20131.3 million km2 between 2015 and 2050, an increase of 78%\u2013171% over the urban footprint in 2015. This urban land expansion will result in average summer daytime and nighttime warming in air temperature of 0.5 °C\u20130.7 °C, up to ~3 °C in some locations. This warming is on average about half, and sometimes up to two times, as strong as that caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (multi-model ensemble average projections in Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5). This extra urban expansion-induced warming, presented here, will increase extreme heat risks for about half of the future urban population, primarily in the tropical Global South, where existing forecasts already indicate stronger GHG emissions-warming and lack of adaptive capacity. In these vulnerable urban areas, policy interventions to restrict or redistribute urban expansion and planning strategies to mitigate UHIs are needed to reduce the wide ranges of impacts on human health, energy system, urban ecosystem, and infrastructures.",

         "user" : "simon.brown",
         "description" : "\r\n\r\nThis review addresses the causes of observed climate variations across the industrial period, from 1750 to present. It focuses on long-term changes, both in response to external forcing and to climate variability in the ocean and atmosphere. A synthesis of results from attribution studies based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions covering the recent few centuries to the 20th century, and instrumental data shows how greenhouse gases began to cause warming since the beginning of industrialization, causing trends that are attributable to greenhouse gases by 1900 in proxy-based temperature reconstructions. Their influence increased over time, dominating recent trends. However, other forcings have caused substantial deviations from this emerging greenhouse warming trend: volcanic eruptions have caused strong cooling following a period of unusually heavy activity, such as in the early 19th century; or warming during periods of low activity, such as in the early-to-mid 20th century. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing most likely masked some global greenhouse warming over the 20th century, especially since the accelerated increase in sulphate aerosol emissions starting around 1950. Based on modelling and attribution studies, aerosol forcing has also influenced regional temperatures, caused long-term changes in monsoons and imprinted on Atlantic variability. Multi-decadal variations in atmospheric modes can also cause long-term climate variability, as apparent for the example of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and have influenced Atlantic ocean variability. Long-term precipitation changes are more difficult to attribute to external forcing due to spatial sparseness of data and noisiness of precipitation changes, but the observed pattern of precipitation response to warming from station data supports climate model simulated changes and with it, predictions. The long-term warming has also led to significant differences in daily variability as, for example, visible in long European station data. Extreme events over the historical record provide valuable samples of possible extreme events and their mechanisms.\r\n",

The most obvious obstacle is the company's current reliance on natural gas as a fuel source. Not only are its installations dependent on the availability of distribution infrastructure, but Bloom also likely will be called upon more often to discuss how it handles methane, a super pollutant associated with natural gas and biogas that is a more potent contributor to global warming than carbon dioxide.",

         "description" : "\r\n\r\nWhile daily extreme precipitation intensities increase with global warming on average at approximately the same rate as the availability of water vapor (~7%/°C), a debated topic is whether sub-daily extremes increase more. Modelling at convection-permitting scales has been deemed necessary to reproduce extreme summer precipitation at local scale. Here we analyze multi-model ensembles and apply a 3 km horizontal resolution model over four regions across Europe (S. Norway, Denmark, Benelux and Albania) and find very good agreement with observed daily and hourly summer precipitation extremes. Projections show that daily extreme precipitation intensifies compared to the mean in all regions and across a wide range of models and resolutions. Hourly and 10 min extremes intensify at a higher rate in nearly all regions. Unlike most recent studies, we do not find sub-daily precipitation extremes increasing much more than 7%/°C, even for sub-hourly extremes, but this may be due to robust summer drying over large parts of Europe. However, the absolute strongest local daily precipitation event in a 20 year period will increase by 10%\u201320%/°C. At the same time, model projections strongly indicate that summer drying will be more pronounced for extremely dry years.\r\n",

         "user" : "simon.brown",
         "description" : "Many countries rely on regional climate model (RCM) projections to quantify the impacts of climate change and to design their adaptation plans accordingly. In several European regions, RCMs project a smaller temperature increase than global climate models (GCMs), which is hypothesised to be due to discrepant representations of topography, cloud processes, or aerosol forcing in RCMs and GCMs. Additionally, RCMs do generally not consider the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations; a process which is, however, included in most GCMs. Plants adapt to higher CO2 concentrations by closing their stomata, which can lead to reduced transpiration with concomitant surface warming, in particular, during temperature extremes. Here we show that embedding plant physiological responses to elevated CO2 concentrations in an RCM leads to significantly higher projected extreme temperatures in Europe. Annual maximum temperatures rise additionally by about 0.6 K (0.1 K in southern, 1.2 K in northern Europe) by 2070\u20132099, explaining about 67% of the stronger annual maximum temperature increase in GCMs compared to RCMs. Missing plant physiological CO2 responses thus strongly contribute to the underestimation of temperature trends in RCMs. The need for robust climate change assessments calls for a comprehensive implementation of this process in RCM land surface schemes.",

Some universities look at internationalization as a contribution to the bottom line in an era of financial cutbacks.

How come there is only one kind of truth?\r\n\r\nFreeman Dyson (2016): Yes, this is of course a question I cannot answer. I have a theory about that. Which has to do with the evolution of humans. We evolved in small tribes. A hang-together-society in which we lived for a million years or so. As small tribes hunting in the forest, competing with each other. That\u2019s how humans evolved. And under those conditions the important thing was loyalty to the tribe. It was absolutely the most important thing to have people totally loyal to the tribe. Holding the tribe together. And whether their beliefs where right or wrong was not so important. As long as they believed the same things they would survive. And I think that is very much driving us still. To be with the herd, to be thinking the same thoughts as other people is build into our nature. So it\u2019s still more important to belong to the tribe than it is to speak the truth. And so I think that explains it a bit. And scientists are not different from other people, we have our tribes also. This believe in global warming, it is a tribal loyalty which is very strong. It\u2019s always difficult for the heretic to find people to believe what he is saying. But still heretics are also important and luckily they are not burned at the stake anymore.",

To improve public health surveillance and,   ultimately, interventions, we examined 3 primary systems that process event-based   outbreak information: Global Public Health Intelligence Network, HealthMap, and   EpiSPIDER. Despite similarities among them, these systems are highly   complementary because they monitor different data types, rely on varying levels   of automation and human analysis, and distribute distinct information. Future   development should focus on linking these systems more closely to public health   practitioners in the field and establishing collaborative networks for alert   verification and dissemination. Such development would further establish   event-based monitoring as an invaluable public health resource that provides   critical context and an alternative to traditional indicator-based outbreak reporting.",

Leaders also need to pay attention to six leadership practices if they want to build a stronger collaborative ethos.\r\nThis style of working is hard especially in a resource-constrained environment. We recommend leaders give greater attention to designing more participatory processes and developing the collaborative skills of other groups of staff.\r\nGiven the pace of change and disruption needed to solve many of the problems facing our health and care system, we recommend leaders extend the practice of collaborative leadership to work with a broader range of local organisations as well as local communities.",

         "description" : "The current frenzy of megamergers and acquisitions creating giant media/entertainment conglomerates has been described in the sociology of sport literature as one of the key aspects of sport globalization processes now unfolding. In this literature three usual suspects are mostly pointed out: Disney, News Corp and AOL\u2013Time Warner. This article argues that one must look beyond these in order to get a clearer picture of the emerging media/sport complex. By examining the corporate structure of six major media/entertainment conglomerates, this article reveals some of the intricacies of these holdings which unpack the \u2018circuits of promotion\u2019 being formed through media platforms and content convergence. Moreover, the analysis of these corporate holdings show how these competitors are also involved in several joint ventures that connect them together, thus forming a dense web despite their rivalries. The article concludes that unless democratic interventions are enabled at the national and global levels sport media consumers will remain easy targets of the global media/ entertainment oligopoly.",

The Workshop idea itself was a result of conversations between the Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organizations at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, the CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation and several IANGO leaders. The IANGO Workshop initiative was launched in recognition of the need to create a platform for collective reflection, personal learning and strategic thinking to facilitate individual and collective action on common challenges and opportunities facing IANGOs working for the promotion of public goods in diverse regions and environments. The IANGO Workshop, co-facilitated by the Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organisations at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation, convened a diverse range of global civil society actors engaged in issues such as poverty alleviation, human rights, citizen participation, women\u2019s rights, environmental advocacy, labour rights and good governance in the aim of addressing the concerns and specific challenges facing organisations working on the global level to not only provide relief and development but to also advocate for the resolution of complex trans-national problems and for the achievement of social, economic and political justice.",

It provides an overview of the different landscapes of each service and the national policy developments that make closer working more desirable and more important. It suggests ways in which barriers to integration can be overcome and presents opportunities for greater collaboration at the level of the individual patient, the local population and the wider system. It includes case studies of areas where primary care and social care have successfully started to integrate services with local communities benefitting from the approach. The case studies are Workingham Integrated Partnership on Health and Social Care, Larwood and Bawtry Primary Care Home, Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership; and West Devon Primary Care Home.

The basic idea is to never do anything in the master branch except use it to move changes between the remote repo and local branches. Keeping master clean takes very little effort and will save your bacon when you get into trouble. The example I'll use here is working on a story to render title text in a bold style on a page.",

         "description" : "\r\n\r\nCompound dry and hot events (i.e. concurrent or consecutive occurrences of dry and hot events), which may cause larger impacts than those caused by extreme events occurring in isolation, have attracted wide attention in recent decades. Increased occurrences of compound dry and hot events in different regions around the globe highlight the importance of improved understanding and modeling of these events so that they can be tracked and predicted ahead of time. In this study, a monitoring and prediction system of compound dry and hot events at the global scale is introduced. The monitoring component consists of two indicators (standardized compound event indicator and a binary variable) that incorporate both dry and hot conditions for characterizing the severity and occurrence. The two indicators are shown to perform well in depicting compound dry and hot events during June\u2013July\u2013August 2010 in western Russia. The prediction component consists of two statistical models, including a conditional distribution model and a logistic regression model, for predicting compound dry and hot events based on El Niño\u2013Southern Oscillation, which is shown to significantly affect compound events of several regions, including northern South America, southern Africa, southeast Asia, and Australia. These models are shown to perform well in predicting compound events in large regions (e.g. northern South America and southern Africa) during December\u2013January\u2013February 2015\u20132016. This monitoring and prediction system could be useful for providing early warning information of compound dry and hot events.\r\n",

The benefit of this approach is that byte code instructions are easier to cross-compile and the difficult parsing of a high-level programming language is left to a regular compiler. In XMLVM, byte code-based programs are represented as XML documents. This allows manipulation and translation of XMLVM-based programs using advanced XML technologies such as XSLT, XQuery, and XPath.

The surveying, analysis and documentation of ancient infrastructures or settlement sites are often carried out by the additional use of geoinformatic software and tools, i.e. embedded in geoinformation systems (GIS). Since these GIS-methods are usually adjusted to the local use case, the spatial dimensions, coordinates, map projections and file formats differ significantly between individual survey sites and/or archaeological focus. Consequently, the interdisciplinary digital fusion and interactive analysis of such regional varying geodata by collaborating teams of archaeologists are often a quite cumbersome procedure. [...]",

This is a relationship-focused and value-based leadership style in which leaders understand that healthcare organisations have been in a state of flux and recognise how to respond constructively to change in the future. Quantum leadership enables nurse leaders to create and maintain synergistic team working, whereby the team works together towards the common goal of delivering optimal person-centred care.

Man habe jetzt schon 10 Jahre an Zeit verloren, in denen über die Klimaerwärmung gesprochen, aber nicht entschieden gehandelt wurde. Es sei jetzt höchste Zeit, bindende Emissionsbeschränkungen und Maßnahmen zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel einzuführen, um die zu erwartenden Schäden zu mindern. Im Blick haben sie die UN-Klimatagung im Juni in Bonn, den G8-Gipfel im Juli in Japan und vor allem die Klimakonferenz 2009 in Kopenhagen, wo es um das Kyoto-Nachfolgeabkommen geht.\r\n\r\nDie Wissenschaftler, die am Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) der Vereinten Nationen beteiligt sind, erklären, dass sie mit ihrer Warnung, die in Nature Reports Climate Change erschienen ist, nicht offiziell im Namen des Klimarats sprechen. Jetzt, so sagen sie, würde man bereits mit den steigenden Lebensmittelpreisen die ersten \"globalen Auswirkungen\" der Klimaerwärmung beobachten können. Sie seien auf Trockenheiten in Herstellerländern wie Australien und auf \"schlecht konzipierte Experimente der Klimapolitik\" zurückzuführen, die Anbauflächen für Lebensmittel zu Biospritflächen gemacht hätten. \"Dies sollte uns als Weckruf dienen: Folgen des Klimawandels können uns überraschen, besonders wenn sie in Verbindung mit anderen Trends zusammenwirken.\"",

DOI:10.1027/0227-5910/a000587\r\nSuicide and attempted suicide/self-harm (suicidal behavior) constitute a major global public health concern, with an estimated annual toll of 793,000 deaths worldwide and up to 20 times as many episodes (no accurate count is possible) of attempts (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014). In order to address the complexity and magnitude of suicidal behavior, national governments have recognized the need to develop and implement suicide prevention strategies that adopt a sustained, coordinated, multisectoral approach, led by a health ministry, involving a range of governmental and nongovernmental agencies working in collaboration, both nationally and locally. These strategies should be grounded firmly in research evidence of approaches (interventions) that are likely to contribute significantly to the prevention of, and reduction in, suicidal behavior. In this editorial the authors discuss (1) what is is national suicide prevention strategy? (2) different pathways recommended for countries at different stages of economic development; (3) barriers to effective implementation of strategy; (4) what do we know about the outcomes of national suicide prevention strategies? and; (5) why has there been so little progress in evaluating national suicide prevention strategies as a whole?.

Safety rounds, in which senior executives spend time on the frontlines of care, talking with staff and observing work, aim to improve safety of healthcare delivery by providing a systematic approach for engaging senior executives with the work system challenges faced by front-line staff and ensuring follow-up and accountability for addressing these challenges. They resemble \u2018Management by Walking Around\u2019, which originated at Hewlett-Packard1 and \u2018gemba walks\u2019, which are considered a key component of the Toyota Production System.2 However, descriptions of these precursor interventions emphasise engagement of senior executives with front-line workers and not follow-up and feedback about ideas generated through observation and discussion.

Many in both the public and private sectors are questioning the cost of higher education, and others are questioning its value. We are being exposed through all forms of media to predominantly negative stories about higher education. As one whose life was transformed by my collegiate experience, and now as a college president, I am a bold and proud apologist for higher education, its value and its necessity to the future of our country and the global economy. With deference to a 2017 report from the Association of Governing Boards entitled \u201CThe Business of Higher Education,\u201D I share some facts about the economic benefits of higher education. A generation ago, a high school graduate earned 77 percent of what a college graduate earned. Today, for millennials, high school graduates will earn 66 percent of their college graduate neighbors. Over a lifetime, that is well over $1 million in additional earning for the college graduate, making the financial value proposition a good one. However, beyond earning potential, the recent study cited other equally important benefits for college graduates: \u201CHigher education\u2026efficiently creates human capital that improves communities and contributes to the economic well-being of the nation over the course of graduates\u2019 entire lives. College graduates enjoy better health, longer lives, and greater degrees of individual and professional satisfaction. \u2026 They also use the skills learned in college to foster democracy and human rights, as well as to accelerate technological advancement.\u201D We have witnessed recent debate within the West Virginia state legislature, as well as in many other state legislatures, concerning appropriations for public higher education. I am a supporter of both a robust public and private higher education sector, and recognize through empirical research, that investing public funds in all types of education is prudent and wise. I offer food for thought concerning the value",

         "description" : "\"We cannot stress enough the importance of ensuring that your electric blanket is safe - as this incident has highlighted, the consequences can be devastating. Older blankets should be replaced.\" Fire Investigation Officer Paul Shaw The fire occurred in the residents house on Louise Street in Burslem yesterday (Thur) morning. A joint fire and police investigation established that the fire was caused by an electric blanket that was at least 20-years-old. Wear and tear on the wires in the blanket caused the wires to arc and produce heat which set fire to surrounding combustibles. Fire Investigation Officer Paul Shaw said: \"This was a tragic accident that sadly could have been avoided. We cannot stress enough the importance of ensuring that your electric blanket is safe - as this incident has highlighted, the consequences can be devastating. Older blankets should be replaced. \"It isnt just older blankets that can put you at risk. We find that a lot of people fold up their electric blankets when theyre not in use, however this can sometimes damage the internal wiring, making them dangerous.\" According to the Electrical Safety Council you should think about replacing your electric blanket every 10 years. It is important to get your blanket checked to make sure it is still safe to use ideally this should be once a year by a competent electrician. Firefighters from Sandyford, Hanley, Newcastle and Biddulph attended the incident after an emergency call was received at 8.11am. They wore breathing apparatus and used two hose reel jets to extinguish the fire. To book a free Home Fire Risk Check contact: 0800 0241 999.

NATO adopted the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, according to which even conventional Soviet attacks would be answered by an all-out nuclear strike. Behind this monstrous shield, liberal democracy and the free market managed to hold out in their last bastions, and Westerners got to enjoy sex, drugs, and rock and roll, as well as washing machines, refrigerators, and televisions. Without nukes there would have been no Beatles, no Woodstock, and no overflowing supermarkets....ut history has not come to an end, and following the Franz Ferdinand moment, the Hitler moment, and the Che Guevara moment we now find ourselves in the Trump moment. This time, however, the Liberal Story is not faced by a coherent ideological opponent like imperialism, fascism, or Communism. The Trump moment is a nihilistic burlesque. Donald Trump has no ideology to speak of, just as the British Brexiteers have no real plan for the future of the Disunited Kingdom... When humans lose their ability to make sense of rapid global change and the old story collapses and leaves a void, we need new ways of thinking, and we need them fast. At present, though, we are still in the nihilist moment of disillusionment and anger, in which people lose faith in the old story but before they have embraced a new one. This is the Trump moment.\"",

For that purpose, MATURE conceives individual learning processes to be interlinked (the output of a learning process is input to others) in a knowledge-maturing process in which knowledge changes in nature.

         "description" : "The regulations make it compulsory for all landlords to fit smoke alarms in rented homes and are expected to come into effect from October 2015, subject to Parliamentary approval. Under the new laws, smoke alarms must be fitted on every floor of the property as well as carbon monoxide alarms in properties which burn solid fuels. Landlords must check the alarms are working at the start of every new tenancy with potential penalties of up to 5,000 if they dont comply. To help landlords gear up for the new regulations the Government has provided Cleveland Fire Brigade with a limited number of free smoke and carbon monoxide alarms to give out to relevant landlords. We are keen to work with local landlords to improve the safety of tenants across our area, said Phil Lancaster, the Brigades Director of Community Protection. We would urge those landlords, who need to take action to comply with the new regulations to visit our website www.clevelandfire.gov.uk/private-landlords , look at the guidance notes and complete the request form if they are eligible for the free smoke alarms and CO Alarms. The number of alarms allocated to us by the Government is limited so we will be dealing with requests from Landlords on a first come first served basis. While deaths and injuries from fires have reduced considerably in recent years, the majority of victims continue to be those who are most vulnerable, often living in private rented accommodation. While overall smoke alarm ownership in the country stands at around 90%, those living in private rented homes are far less likely to have a working smoke alarm. Statistically people are four times more likely to die in a fire in the home if there is no working smoke alarm and over the next 10 years it is estimated that the new laws will result in 231 fewer deaths and 5,860 less injuries. Mr Lancaster continued, We are delighted that the Government has acknowledged that there is still work for the fire service to do to keep people safe in their homes and have brought in these new laws which will improve the safety of families and stop dozens of people from losing their lives to fire each year.

But it's important to know it's working correctly. Jon Hall, chief fire officer, said: \"With darker nights upon us, it is an ideal opportunity to test that small item in your home which could save you or your family's lives. Smoke alarms should be fitted on every level of your home. Get it, install it, check it and change the batteries regularly - it could save your life. Whatever happens, never remove the battery to use it for other purposes.\" If you know of a vulnerable person who doesn't have a working smoke alarm, Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service has a supply of alarms that can be supplied and fitted for free just by ringing 0800 180 41 40. They can fit smoke alarms, advise on safety hazards and how best to remove them and put people in touch with other organisations who can help them. Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, said: \"Smoke alarms save lives. Most of us have them, but are we sure they are working properly?

Using a WOEID, you can query Yahoo's publicly available APIs to find out things like what cities are in a county, or what counties border each other. In an interview for O'Reilly Radar, Tyler Bell, the product lead for the Yahoo Geo Technology Group, talks about their Open Location program (not to be confused with openlocation.org, a different group altogether.) He also talks about how privacy concerns interact with the increasing use of personal geotracking, and the troublesome problem of what to call places. 'I'm not even going to tell you about the problems we had when we accidentally called Constantinople Byzantium, just slipping back about 800 years there accidentally. That's a very sensitive issue. Any company dealing with geography is going to have to address it somehow. So I'll be very candid in how Yahoo addresses this. I mean first, our stated goal is to capture the world's geography as it is used by the world's people. We don't see ourselves as the definitive authority on how a place should be called.",

         "description" : "Communication skills are fundamental to social work, yet few studies have directly evaluated their impact. In this study, we explore the relationship between skills and outcomes in 127 families. An observation of practice was undertaken on the second or third meeting with a family. Practice quality was evaluated in relation to seven skills, which were grouped into three dimensions: relationship building, good authority and evocation of intrinsic motivation. Outcomes at approximately six months were parent-reported engagement (Working Alliance Inventory), Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), an eleven-point family life satisfaction rating, the Family Environment Scale and General Health Questionnaire and service outcomes from agency records including children entering care. Relationship-building skills predicted parent-reported engagement, although good authority and evocation had stronger relationships with outcome measures. Where workers visited families more often, relationships between skills and outcomes were stronger, in part because workers had more involvement and in part because these families were more likely to have significant problems. The relationship between skills and outcomes was complicated, although the findings provide encouraging evidence that key social work skills have an influence on outcomes for families.

         "description" : " I think a fair number of these questions are implicitly asking how we make Sublime fast. The answer is probably more mundane than most people expect.\r\n\r\nAt our core, we do less.\r\n\r\nOur codebase is full of purpose-built code that does exactly what we need it to, and no more. I think this has been a combination of intentionally pursuing the simplest solution, and the fact that Jon built Sublime Text by himself for the majority of its existence. As the product has matured and we\u2019ve added more engineering resources, we\u2019ve tried to continue walking the balance of making the codebase more robust, while continuing to pursue simplicity.\r\n\r\nSublime Text is written in C++. I could talk about how we avoid exceptions, use move semantics, and how a bunch of our code looks rather like C. These aren\u2019t why Sublime products are fast, but they contribute some. Choosing the right data structures is important, yes. Surprisingly, a vector is more often the correct choice than I would have originally presumed. Our code pre-allocates vectors to their final size. We use memory arenas and intern strings. We pay attention to struct padding and use contiguous memory allocations for improved cache locality.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll probably notice there is an overarching theme. We use less memory. We allocate fewer times. We invalidate the cache fewer times. We do less work. In reality, we have the user\u2019s machine do less work. Sometime we end up doing more work, to chase that goal. Yes, we profile things to improve performance, but the little decisions add up! ",

FILE PIC (Ernest Doroszuk/Toronto Sun/Postmedia Network) Article Competition Bureau calls for relaxing taxi rules in face of competition Calgary convinced a court to ban Uber from operating there and Toronto cabbies want their city to do the same. Toronto Taxi Alliance spokesman Sam Moini said the temporary injunction granted Friday should serve as a lesson to Toronto. We have a very powerful bylaw and Im very confident that it will win in court, he said. I think the City of Toronto should take notice of what happened in Calgary and file an injunction against Uber here in Toronto. Calgary officials will have to return to court Dec. 17 to argue for a permanent injunction against Uber. Toronto officials went down this road earlier this year. Judge Sean Dunphy denied the city an injunction in July, saying its up to council to bring Uber under its regulatory regime, not the courts to ban the business. In October, council voted to outlaw Uber under the citys current taxi and limo rules and to have staff report back by the spring on a way to regulate the ridesharing company. Moini says Uber is operating illegally in the city and its drivers dont carry the proper insurance and arent subject to the same rigorous inspection rules applied to the taxi industry.

The idea is that any benefit provided by the company to the shareholder/director shall be included in his/her taxable income. Alternatively, you can outsource your quality control audits to a third party, such as Mortgage Compliance advisers, LLB. The better you document your business expenses, the easier the claim is to justify during an IRS audit. Withhold judgement longer.",

         "description" : "Americans are often expected to have some level of higher education before they enter the workforce. These political leaders are asking: Shouldn\u2019t government help them along? CHICAGO\u2014A surge of innovation in states and cities is building momentum for what could become a seismic shift in American education. Just as the country came to expect in the decades around World War II that young people would finish at least 12 years of school, more local governments are now working to ensure that students complete at least 14 years. With that change, political leaders in both parties are increasingly acknowledging that if society routinely expects students to obtain at least two years of schooling past high school, government has a responsibility to provide it for them cost-free. That impulse animates the statewide tuition-free community-college program pioneered under Republican Governor Bill Haslam in Tennessee and replicated under Democratic Governor Kate Brown in Oregon; Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s Star Scholarship, which funds two years of community college for students who complete high school with a B average; and the legislation Governor Andrew Cuomo recently signed into law providing tuition-free access to two- and four-year public colleges in New York for families earning up to $125,000. The Campaign for Free College Tuition, an organization promoting this movement, expects representatives from up to 18 states to join their conference next month in Denver. Ben Cannon, executive director of the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission, speaks for many devising these initiatives when he insists: \u201CAs a state, we generally acknowledge and understand that a high-school education is not enough, and [tuition-free community college] represents an attempt to extend that [public-education] entitlement to 14 years.\u201D",

         "description" : "The UK government will decide whether BPP University should continue to be eligible for university title and degree-awarding powers, after its US owner was sold to a private equity consortium for $1.1 billion (£899 million). BPP, one of only three for-profit universities in the UK, saw the sale of its owner, Apollo Education Group, completed last month. The deal, which takes the company private, also includes its big US for-profit institutions, such as the University of Phoenix and Western International University. The new owners are a consortium including Vistria Group, a private equity firm run by Marty Nesbitt \u2013 a Chicago businessman sometimes described as Barack Obama\u2019s best friend \u2013 and former US deputy education secretary Tony Miller. The consortium also includes \u201Cfunds affiliated\u201D with private equity firm Apollo Global Management, according to the Washington Post. The change of ownership for BPP comes as the UK government nears the final stages of steering through Parliament the Higher Education and Research Bill, which aims to further open England\u2019s sector to new private and for-profit providers. While ministers believe that new providers are needed to introduce greater competition for established universities, critics believe creating more for-profit universities that can go through repeated changes in ownership may have an impact on quality for students. An independent review of BPP will now be submitted to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, including checks on whether the institution continues to meet student number and governance requirements. Hefce will, in turn, advise the Department for Education on the institution's future status. Carl Lygo, BPP's vice-chancellor, said that \"nothing has changed\" at the university since the sale was announced. \"Neither of the new owners has any record in delivering higher education in the UK and so their plans will be carefully scrutinised by the Department for Education,\" Professor Lygo said. \"This is not a rubber stamp process.\" A DfE spok",

The Grom is an unmanned attack aircraft capable of performing intelligence, surveillance, and intelligence, strike, and electronic warfare missions either on its own, as a loyal wing working together with a manned aircraft, or in a networked autonomous swarm. \"The unmanned vehicle has a mass of seven tons and a payload of about 500 kilograms,\" said Nikolay Dolzhenkov, general designer of the Kronstadt company. \"The new drone will operate in one connection with the Su-35 and Su-57 fighters.\" Russian first home-made stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicle will be a copy of a Kratos' XQ-58A Valkyrie with some refinements, according to analysts. The Valkyrie system, developed by Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) on the Low-Cost Attritable Strike Demonstrator (LCASD) Program, is a low-cost, multi-mission, runway-independent unmanned air vehicle capable of long-range flights and high-subsonic speeds intended to support a variety of defense mission applications.

LONDON (AP) -- Stan Wawrinka grabbed the last semifinal spot at the ATP World Tour finals by beating Andy Murray 7-6 (4), 6-4 Friday in the last group-stage match at the season-ending tournament. Murray led 4-2 in the first-set tiebreaker but then lost the next five points and was broken in the first game of the second to put Wawrinka in control. The French Open champion broke again for a 5-2 lead but needed two attempts to serve out the match. He saved two break points at 5-4 before converting his second match point when Murray's backhand went wide. Wawrinka will play Swiss compatriot Roger Federer on Saturday, while Rafael Nadal faces Novak Djokovic in the other semifinal. Nadal beat David Ferrer 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4 earlier to finish the group stage unbeaten.

The demonstration saw fire crews cutting a casualty, who had supposedly been drinking and wasnt wearing a seatbelt, from one of the cars. The pedestrian, who had also been drinking, had caused the accident after walking into the path of one of the cars. The scenario was designed to raise awareness not only of the dangers of drink-driving and not wearing seatbelts, but also of pedestrians and other road users not being aware of their surroundings because of inappropriate drinking or other distractions. Distraction, which is believed to be a major factor in the number of incidents and injuries experienced in the county, will also be the focus of fire crews and Risk Reduction Officers in Nottingham city next week. . From Monday (2 June) passers-by at Central Fire Station will be reminded of what could happen when drivers are distracted by their mobile phone, passengers or attempting to change a CD, when firefighters place a supposed crashed car on the station forecourt. The smashed vehicle will be on display until Friday (6 June) when fire crewswillbe asking passers-by to take part in some fun, but thought-provoking, challenges to demonstrate how concentration can be affected when drivers are distracted. The event is hoping to attract the attention of students from nearby Nottingham Trent University, as well as other passers-by in the city centre. Members of the City Risk Reduction Team will be on hand to give advice and answer questions.

         "description" : "'Water' fun day! Friday 15 August 2014 Mansfield Fire Station played host to a group of children from Chernobyl this week as part of their annual month-long break in the East Midlands. The children were visiting with Chernobyl Children Lifeline, an organisation that aims to extend the lifespan of children from Chernobyl by organising trips away. During their visit to the station they were able to see some of the equipment and techniques used by our firefighters, but no doubt the highlight of the day was the chance to soak one of our firefighters with water! Local photographer and host parent for the visit, Rob Ferrol, said it had been a huge privilege to visit the station with the children. They all had an amazing time and the crew on duty were fantastic hosts, he said. On behalf of the charity we cannot thank them enough. White Watch were on duty and special thanks must go to Watch Manager Darren Warner, Crew Manager Garry Mulligan and firefighters Les Hallam, Lee Braidley and Paul Smith. As well as taking lots of photos for the children to take home with them, Rob also supplied some to us showing the children and our crew in action, for which we are most grateful.

Just two months ago a six-strong team representing Cleveland Fire Brigade visited Harare in Zimbabwe where they spent three weeks training local firefighters in a range of fire and rescue exercises including measures to prevent injuries and save lives. Ian Hayton, Chief Fire Officer with Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: The four appliances are around 20 years old and have come to the end of their useful working lives for Cleveland Fire Brigade. They have very little monetary value and it therefore makes sense to donate them to Operation Florian which is an extremely worthwhile charity that does great work around the world to help others less fortunate than ourselves. A number of our firefighters have just returned from Harare in Zimbabwe where they passed on their skills and expertise to local firefighters as part of Operation Florian. Whilst the firefighters there are quite highly skilled, they just dont have the equipment that we have and often attend incidents in vans and trucks. Hopefully, we can help to change this with the donation of our surplus appliances. Councillor Jan Brunton, Chair of Cleveland Fire Authority, commented: Having listened to the Cleveland firefighters who have visited Zimbabwe recently, it brings it home to me just how far advanced we are in this country in terms of our fire and rescue services. Through Operation Florian there is some tremendous work to support others less privileged than ourselves and I think it is very fitting for Cleveland Fire Brigade to support this charity. Mike Doherty, Chair of Operation Florian, said: The four appliances donated by Cleveland Fire Brigade is a significant contribution to the charity and there is no doubt that this will help to save many lives in the years to come. Cleveland Fire Brigade has been incredibly supportive of the work that we do. They not only donate equipment; they show their counterparts in impoverished parts of the world how to use it and their commitment is second to none.

         "description" : "Generally, prestigious private universities with hundreds of students don't get shut down over fairly minor, six-month-old technical issues that have since been resolved. But that is precisely the predicament facing the two-decade-old European University at St. Petersburg, a bastion of Western liberal arts, which has been ordered closed by a district court after a furious conservative assault against it. What appears to be on full display is a hallmark of the Vladimir Putin-era: a new brand of domestic \"lawfare,\" in which state-run courts enforce political conformity through legal pretexts. Unlike blatant Soviet-style repression, outcomes are shaped through complicated, often years-long court battles that seem to lead inexorably to the politically desired verdict. One illustrative recent example is a local court's upholding of an embezzlement conviction against opposition leader Alexei Navalny, which has the collateral effect of barring him from running in presidential elections that are about a year away. Kremlin supporters will denounce such a description as an example of Western arrogance, aimed at defaming Russian courts and rule of law. It's a debate that cannot be easily settled. 'Fake studies'? But consider the case of the European University, a private post-graduate school that currently has about 260 students \u2013 many of them from abroad \u2013 and whose main campus occupies the magnificent Small Marble Palace in St. Petersburg's historic heart. The school was founded in a different political era, in 1994, with support from the city's then-mayor, reformist Anatoly Sobchak, and substantial donations from a range of international organizations, including the Soros, MacArthur, and Spencer foundations. It's one of the few private universities in Russia that is fully licensed to issue graduate degrees by the Ministry of Education, and has been consistently rated among the top universities in Russia. The school's curriculum is heavy on political science, sociology, history, and economics. Many classes are tau",

Every year pedestrians are needlessly injured or killed on our roads. With a little thought and preparation these deaths and injuries can be avoided. Wearing reflective clothing and carrying a torch immediately makes you much more visible to motorists. Carmel Warren, Prevent Manager for the west The torches will be handed out to selected schools and older peoples organisations across west Staffordshire. It is hoped school children will use the torches walking to and from school and older people will use them when they are out and about. These two groups are particularly at risk of being injured or tragically killed on our roads or in their homes during the darker months as a result of reduced visibility. Accidents involving children are more likely to happen as they journey between home and school. All pedestrians are advised to wear brightly coloured or fluorescent clothing which can be seen in car headlights during the darker mornings and evenings. Reflective clothing is needed at night and torches, reflective arm bands, stickers or accessories are an additional way to ensure you are seen when out and about.

A 41-year-old man from Vendome, France, with a suspected firearm was arrested about 9:30 a.m. local time after he was spotted acting suspiciously. Sussex Police said the man was at a pre-screening area when he was taken into custody. He had not checked in or passed through any passport or security checks. Police found \"personal items and what appears to be a firearm\" in connection to the incident. Police said, \"the viability of the weapon has yet to be established.\" \"The man is being interviewed as we try to determine the circumstances of the incident, but at this time it is too early to say what his intentions, if any, were,\" Sussex police Detective Superintendent Nick May said. \"However, given the events in Paris on Friday evening, there is heightened awareness around any such incident and it is best that we treat the matter in all seriousness.\" At least 128 people were killed in coordinated attacks at several locations in Paris on Friday night. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility. Gatwick airport authorities said the north terminal was evacuated as a \"precautionary measure.\" Once the north terminal was reopened, airport officials encouraged passengers to check with their airlines about their travels. \"Following a full and thorough search by the police, we are now able to re-open our north terminal to passengers,\" airport officials said. \"Our priority is always the safety and welfare of our passengers and extra Gatwick staff are on hand to assist those who have experienced significant disruption to their journey today. We are working with our airlines to return north terminal to usual operations. South terminal is operating as normal.\" Evacuees took to social media, describing the scene as \"quiet chaos\" with hundreds of people corralled and \"lots of men with guns and police.\" Gatwick is London's second busiest airport and is located about 30 miles from the capital. Emma Goodson was traveling from Malaga, Spain to Gatwick. Goodson told UPI she expected to land at the north terminal but instead landed at the south terminal.

You will also find a huge selection of modern, stylish fire doors which are all available at great, online prices When the clocks go forward this weekend make sure you only lose an hour and not your life - by checking your smoke alarms at the same time. Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service (GFRS) is encouraging residents to ensure their families are safe and all the alarms in the house are working as British Summer Time starts this Sunday (30th March). A total of 211 people across the country died in fires in the home last year, and more than 70 per cent of these weren't alerted to the fire by a smoke alarm, so it's vital to test them regularly. A working smoke alarm can buy families the valuable time they need to get out, stay out and call 999. Chief Fire Officer Stewart Edgar said: \"Anyone can spot when a clock stops ticking, but it's not so easy to be sure that your smoke alarm is still in working order.\" \"And, as more than half of the people who died in home fires last year were 65 years old or above, this is also a perfect opportunity to test alarms for older relatives who might find it hard to reach their alarms but are at greater risk.\" \"By pushing the test button on every smoke alarm, you could save the lives of your nearest and dearest.\" Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"There's no excuse not to have your smoke alarm tested regularly, and this is the perfect opportunity for people to make sure their family is safe.\" Smoke alarms are inexpensive - less than 10 from DIY stores and many supermarkets. GFRS Community Safety Advisers identify fire risks within the homes of the most vulnerable people in our communities. They can fit smoke alarms free of charge, advise on hazards and how best to remove them and put householders in touch with other agencies that can provide systems such as telecare (equipment that allows people to call for help and assistance). If you know of a vulnerable person who doesn't have a working smoke alarm, GFRS has a supply of alarms that can be supplied and fitted for free just by ringing 0800 180 41 40. Ends How do I look after my smoke alarm? Once a week - Check the alarm by pressing the button Once a year - Change your battery (unless it's a 10-year alarm) Twice a year - Vacuum and wipe the smoke alarm casing to ensure dust isn't blocking the sensor chamber (For mains wired alarms, switch off first) Every 10 years - fit a replacement smoke alarm.

These costumes caught light very easily, burned quickly and if a child had been wearing one when it caught light they could easily have been killed. That is why we are recommending that people use LED candles and not naked flames. Our test showed just how combustible these childrens costumes can be so our advice is avoid naked flames at all costs. These costumes are made from synthetic materials so as well as burning they will melt and stick to the skin causing horrific burns. If someones clothes catch light they should stop, drop and roll. The correct procedure is to drop to the floor immediately and roll around to smother the flames. Under no circumstances should these costumes be worn on fireworks night. They are simply not safe to be around fires and fireworks. ECFRS has joined calls from the Chief Fire Officers Association for this classification to be changed so that fancy dress costumes are subject to the same safety standards as childrens nightclothes. To have a safe and spooky Halloween our advice is: - It is far safer to use flickering LED candles than real candles in pumpkins and as part of displays. - Make sure that fancy dress costumes and masks are labelled as flame-resistant.

In all the team have helped to secure the conviction of 80 arsonists since the partnership between GMFRS and GMP began five years ago. Deputy Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner Jim Battle said: By working together, police, fire, communities, and local councils across Greater Manchester have done much in recent years to help make bonfire night a safer, enjoyable time for everyone. The work of the fire investigation team is a prime example of this. To those who still want to try and spoil the party, the message remains clear its not acceptable to put yourself and others at risk with dangerous bonfires or out-of-control fireworks. Of course people want to have fun and enjoy themselves and quite right too. But not at the cost of their own safety or others. Please be safe. Dont let a thoughtless moment of autumn fun escalate into anti-social behaviour or much worse a life-changing tragedy. Assistant County Fire Officer and Director of Prevention and Protection, Geoff Harris, said: The period around Halloween and Bonfire Night always sees an increase in arson.

There's a massive selection of fire doors, many with free UK delivery on http://roydnhl.hazblog.com/ Last year there was a six percent increase in deliberate fires across Cleveland over the bonfire period 15 October to 12 November costing the local community nearly half a million pounds. We are reminding the public and in particular young people that unofficial bonfires are classed as arson and anyone found deliberately setting fires could end up with a criminal record. The Brigade will be working together with Cleveland Police and councils for the next four weeks on initiatives including patrolling hot-spot areas, school visits and removing bonfire rubbish. Ian Hayton, Chief Fire Officer said: These unofficial bonfires cause a nuisance to local people and ultimately cost the community money. They also tie up fire engines that should be undertaking vital life-saving prevention work or attending real emergencies. We want to be clear unofficial bonfires are classed as arson incidents. Not only could they lead to criminal records they are inherently dangerous. Rubbish fires can spread quickly and the consequences can be horrific for anyone caught in the flames, so please dont get involved in unofficial bonfires or let your children attend one. If you spot an unofficial bonfire being built please call us on 01429 872311 and we will work with local councils to remove the danger. Chief Superintendent Glenn Gudgeon of Cleveland Police added: We want the public to work with us to ensure those who are intent on causing criminal damage are reported to police. I am urging the public not to tolerate fire setting in their community and report any incidents immediately. We will be carrying out additional patrols over this busy period but hope the community will join us in ensuring those who do set out to cause wanton damage are reported and stopped. If anyone has any information about arson or anti-social behaviour in their area, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or the Police on 101.

The respective Station Managers and four members of the Ceremonial Squad also attended the event. Those who received an award in the north of the county include: Sam Copeland, Biddulph, Lee Turner, Burlsem, Graham Jones, Hanley, Carl Speakman, Burlsem, Gareth Salisbury, Kidsgrove, Oliver Thomas, Kidsgrove, Lee Towey, Ipstones, and Stephen Wright, Cheadle. Those who received an award in the west of the county include: Marc Longworth, Gnosall, and Joe Thompson, Codsall. Those who received an award in the east of the county include: Warren Clark, Lichfield, and Anthony Doolan, Barton-under-Needwood. Learning and Development Training Manager Ed Case, who hosted the evening, said: \"Id like to congratulate everyone who has achieved the status of becoming fully competent. It is no mean feat, particularly on top of other commitments that people may have. \"The Celebration of Success is a wonderful opportunity for the friends and family to gain an understanding of all of the hard work and effort that the participants have put in over a number of years and it is a great chance for the Service to show its appreciation too.\" Following an initial induction, the retained firefighters have studied four modules acquiring the necessary knowledge, skills and understanding in using firefighting equipment, dealing with hazardous materials, wearing breathing apparatus, medical assistance, water training and using specialist cutting equipment at road traffic collisions. During the evening of celebration, the new firefighters, their families and friends viewed a DVD which demonstrated how they trained for during the course. The firefighters are all retained which means they are on call and respond to emergencies via an alerter. The recipients all joined Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service within the last 36 months and have been working over this period of time to complete each of the training modules whilst serving at their respective stations.

Deeney had previously equalised from the penalty spotwith only three minutes left on the clock after Memphis Depay 's first-half opener. The win puts United top of the Premier League, with Manchester City , Arsenal and Leicester City having the chance to surpass them when they play later on Saturday. \"I think this was three points that were very important for us,\" Schweinsteiger told BT Sport. \"The last matchday was also very important for us as we got two points closer to Manchester City and Arsenal. \"Next match we are playing Leicester, it will also be difficult but if we can win that match too then we will be happy with where we are in the Premier League. \"In football you always fight for 93 minutes and you always have to believe in it because it was unlucky to get the penalty and then Deeney scored. \"You always have to give the best until the referee's whistle, there was also a little bit of luck [with the winning goal] but we are happy that we made three points as here it is very difficult to play. The angle was not so easy but of course Deeney did touch the ball.\" Schweinsteiger also praised the performance of David de Gea in the United goal, with his excellent save from Almen Abdi in the second half a standout moment. \"David is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and we are happy that he stayed here,\" said the former Bayern Munich star.

Our calculated ground-ice distribution contains improvements over previous work in that we include the effects of the high thermal conductivity of ice-cemented soil at and below the ice table, we include the surface elevation dependence of the near-surface atmospheric humidity, and we utilize new high resolution maps of thermal inertia, albedo, and elevation from Mars Global Surveyor observations. Results indicate that ground ice should be about 5 times shallower than in previous predictions. While results are dependent on the atmospheric humidity, depths are generally between a few millimeters and a few meters with typical values of a few centimeters. Results are also geographically similar to previous predictions with differences due to the higher resolution of thermal inertia and the inclusion of elevation effects on humidity. Comparison with the measured epithermal-neutron count rates in the southern hemisphere indicate that the geographic distribution of the count rate is best correlated with ground ice in equilibrium with 10 to 20 pr μm (precipitable micrometers) column abundance of atmospheric water, assuming a uniform distribution with CO2; however, given the uncertainties, 5 to 30 pr μm also may be viable. This water abundance represents a longer-term average over 100 to 1000 yr. There is a high degree of correlation between the depth of the ice table and the epithermal count rate that agrees remarkably well with predicted count rates as a function of ice-table depth. These results indicate that ground ice in the upper meter of the martian soil is in diffusive equilibrium with the atmosphere. Since ground ice in this depth zone is expected to undergo saturation/desiccation cycles with orbital variations, this ice should be younger than about 500 kyr and was emplaced under similar cold and dry climate conditions of today. Remaining differences between the predicted depths of the ice table and those inferred from the neutron data are likely to be due to subpixel heterogeneity in the martian surface including the presence of rocks, slopes, and patches of soil with varying thermophysical properties.\r\n\r\n",

With unique power and authenticity, the Museum teaches millions of people each year about the dangers of unchecked hatred and the need to prevent genocide. And we encourage them to act, cultivating a sense of moral responsibility among our citizens so that they will respond to the monumental challenges that confront our world. Today we face an alarming rise in Holocaust denial and antisemitism\u2014even in the very lands where the Holocaust happened\u2014as well as genocide and threats of genocide in other parts of the world. All of this when we are soon approaching a time when Holocaust survivors and other eyewitnesses will no longer be alive.\r\n\r\nThe Museum works closely with many key segments of society who will affect the future of our nation. Professionals from the fields of law enforcement, the judiciary and the military, as well as diplomacy, medicine, education and religion study the Holocaust, with emphasis on the role of their particular professions and the implications for their own responsibilities. These programs intensify their sense of commitment to the core values of their fields and their roles in the protection of individuals and society.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its leadership training programs, the Museum sponsors on-site and traveling exhibitions, educational outreach, Web site, campus outreach and Holocaust commemorations, including the nation\u2019s annual observance in the U.S. Capitol. Our Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies works to ensure the continued growth and vitality of the field of Holocaust studies. As a living memorial to the Holocaust, we work to prevent genocide in the future through our Academy for Genocide Prevention which trains foreign policy professionals. Working with Holocaust survivors and an array of organizations, the Museum is a leader in galvanizing attention to the crisis in Darfur.\r\n\r\nSince its dedication in 1993, the Museum has welcomed more than 25 million visitors, including more than 8 million school children and 85 heads of state. Today 90 percent of the Museum\u2019s visitors are not Jewish, and our Web site, the world\u2019s leading online authority on the Holocaust, had 15 million visits in 2006 from an average of 100 different countries daily. With hundreds of thousands of online visitors from countries with majority Muslim populations, translating our Web site into Arabic and Farsi is a top priority; already, portions are available in more than 20 languages.

         "user" : "yucoo",
         "description" : "Frequency converters play a significant role in industrial applications by allowing the control and manipulation of electrical power supply. These devices are also known as variable frequency drives or inverters. Let me explain their importance and how they are used.\r\n\r\nIn industrial settings, different equipment such as motors, pumps, compressors, and fans require a specific frequency of electrical power to operate efficiently. The standard power supply in many countries is typically 50 or 60 Hz. However, some applications may require a different or variable frequency to meet specific operational requirements.\r\n\r\nFrequency converters convert the fixed frequency of the incoming power supply to a variable frequency output. This conversion allows precise control over the speed and torque of various electrical machines. By adjusting the frequency, operators can fine-tune the performance of industrial equipment, achieving optimal efficiency and better process control.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of how frequency converters are used in industrial applications:\r\n\r\nSpeed Control: Electric motors, such as those used in conveyor systems or pumps, often need adjustable speeds. Frequency converters alter the frequency of the power supply, allowing precise speed control and energy savings. Adjustable speeds enhance process control and adaptability, leading to improved productivity and reduced wear and tear on machinery.\r\n\r\nSoft Starting: Large motors typically draw high currents when they are started directly on-line. This sudden surge can cause voltage sags, equipment damage, and inefficient operation. Frequency converters overcome this issue by providing a controlled and gradual ramp-up of motor speeds. This \"soft start\" feature minimizes stress on the motor and reduces peak current demand, extending equipment lifespan.\r\n\r\nEnergy Optimization: Some industrial processes may be more efficient at certain frequencies. By using frequency converters, operators can customize the power supply's frequency to match the specific demands of the equipment. This optimization helps reduce energy consumption, thus lowering operation costs and promoting sustainability.\r\n\r\nPower Grid Compatibility: In facilities where multiple electrical systems coexist, frequency converters enable power grid compatibility. For example, if the local power grid operates at a different frequency than the equipment requires, frequency converters can bridge the gap, ensuring seamless operation.\r\n\r\nOverall, frequency converters are vital components in industrial applications, allowing operators to precisely control electrical power supply, enhance equipment performance, optimize energy consumption, and ensure smooth compatibility with varying power grids.",

Maggie Hassan really backpedaling in her position on Syrian refugees, as her Republican critics insist? Well let you be the judge. On Monday, Hassans spokesman issued a statement saying in part: (T)he Governor believes that the federal government should halt acceptance of refugees from Syria until intelligence and defense officials can assure that the process for vetting all refugees, including those from Syria, is as strong as possible to ensure the safety of the American people. On Wednesday, Hassan wrote in an opinion piece in the New Hampshire Union Leader: I have called for the federal government to temporarily halt acceptance of refugees from Syria until intelligence and defense officials can assure that the process for vetting all refugees is as strong as possible to ensure public safety. This should be a temporary measure. The federal government can and must work in a timely fashion to conduct a thorough re-evaluation of every step in the screening process, including ensuring proper resources for departments responsible for carrying out these screenings. Hassan was on a conference call hosted by the White House on Tuesday night that included 33 other governors, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and officials of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department and the FBI. According to a White House statement, the federal officials briefed the governors on the rigorous screening and security vetting process that is required before a refugee is able to travel to the United States. Hassan spokesman William Hinkle said that during the call: Gov. Hassan specifically emphasized that the federal government is not doing enough to communicate with state and local public safety officials about who is being resettled, what their backgrounds are, and how they have been screened. Gov. Hassan called for improved, regular communications from the federal government to state and local officials and a better coordination system, a call that was echoed by other governors.

It is vital for those who work in the emergency services to look after their mental health and for us as an organisation to support them in this. Chief Fire Officer Peter Dartford The signing ceremony took place at 9.30am this morning and representatives from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service pledged their support to the Blue Light Programme, promoting a better understanding of mental health problems while offering support and wellbeing advice to their staff and volunteers. Chief Fire Officer Peter Dartford said: Statistics show that in any given year, one in four people in the UK will experience a mental health problem. Firefighters can often find themselves in some very challenging situations and the impact upon crews cannot be underestimated. It is vital for those who work in the emergency services to look after their mental health and for us as an organisation to support them in this. In Staffordshire, the Service has already launched a number of health initiatives in partnership with Age UK, Public Health England and local Health and Wellbeing Boards in a bid to keep local communities as safe as possible. The Blue Light Time to Change pledge supports our long-term message that prevention is always better than cure. Signing the Blue Light Time to Change pledge demonstrates the Services commitment to challenge the stigma attached to mental health and to promote positive health and wellbeing in the work place. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue joins the wide movement of emergency service employers and associations that have pledged to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination, including Derbyshire Fire & Rescue, Kent Fire and Rescue Kent Police, Leicestershire Police, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust. Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind, said: Not only are many of our blue light personnel struggling with their mental health, but theyre less likely to seek support or have time off sick than the general workforce.

         "user" : "thorade",
         "description" : "Git is distributed version control system focused on speed, effectivity and real-world usability on large projects. Its highlights include:      * Distributed development. Like most other modern version control systems, Git gives each developer a local copy of the entire development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as additional development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch. Repositories can be easily accessed via the efficient Git protocol (optionally wrapped in ssh for authentication and security) or simply using HTTP - you can publish your repository anywhere without any special webserver configuration required.     * Strong support for non-linear development. Git supports rapid and convenient branching and merging, and includes powerful tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history.     * Efficient handling of large projects. Git is very fast and scales well even when working with large projects and long histories. It is commonly an order of magnitude faster than most other version control systems, and several orders of magnitude faster on some operations. It also uses an extremely efficient packed format for long-term revision storage that currently tops any other open source version control system.     * Cryptographic authentication of history. The Git history is stored in such a way that the name of a particular revision (a \"commit\" in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. Also, tags can be cryptographically signed.     * Toolkit design. Following the Unix tradition, Git is a collection of many small tools written in C, and a number of scripts that provide convenient wrappers. Git provides tools for both easy human usage and easy scripting to perform new clever operations.  Besides providing a version control system, the Git project provides a generic low-level toolkit for tree history storage and directory content management. Traditionally, the toolkit is called the plumbing. Aside the user interface coming with Git itself, several other projects (so-called porcelains) offer compatible version control interfaces - see the related tools list.",

The club has already established weekly classes including a \u201CSay it Ain\u2019t Sew\u201D class for craft sewing, a yoga class set to deep house music and the All The Young Nudes life drawing class. Mariusz Bogacki, the club\u2019s events coordinator, said he wanted to transform the club from a place where clubbers \u201Cnot only come to get drinking, but to debate too\u201D, and throw open the venue to local people and the community. \u201CI\u2019ve been employed to turn the venue into more than a club, and want it to be a social space to reignite the feeling of community. This is an unusual idea for Edinburgh but it is happening in many other European cities,\u201D Bogacki said. \u201CThe Old Town has been revived with a lot of gentrification. There are new venues popping up on every corner but there\u2019s been nothing which really brings all people, different sorts and ages, together. \u201CWhat I want to do is reignite this feeling of community, break boundaries and influence students and clubbers to see the venue in a different way. \u201CI\u2019m a big fan of Alex Dunedin and his project the Ragged University. It\u2019s great and fits in with what we want to do. \u201CWe talked about I, Daniel Blake in January and I thought it would be ideal to screen at the club. It fits in with the current climate of austerity, rising flat prices and student debt.\u201D Dunedin, the man behin",

         "description" : "Last year there was a six percent increase in deliberate fires across Cleveland over the bonfire period 15 October to 12 November costing the local community nearly half a million pounds. We are reminding the public and in particular young people that unofficial bonfires are classed as arson and anyone found deliberately setting fires could end up with a criminal record. The Brigade will be working together with Cleveland Police and councils for the next four weeks on initiatives including patrolling hot-spot areas, school visits and removing bonfire rubbish. Ian Hayton, Chief Fire Officer said: These unofficial bonfires cause a nuisance to local people and ultimately cost the community money. They also tie up fire engines that should be undertaking vital life-saving prevention work or attending real emergencies. We want to be clear unofficial bonfires are classed as arson incidents. Not only could they lead to criminal records they are inherently dangerous. Rubbish fires can spread quickly and the consequences can be horrific for anyone caught in the flames, so please dont get involved in unofficial bonfires or let your children attend one. If you spot an unofficial bonfire being built please call us on 01429 872311 and we will work with local councils to remove the danger. Chief Superintendent Glenn Gudgeon of Cleveland Police added: We want the public to work with us to ensure those who are intent on causing criminal damage are reported to police. I am urging the public not to tolerate fire setting in their community and report any incidents immediately. We will be carrying out additional patrols over this busy period but hope the community will join us in ensuring those who do set out to cause wanton damage are reported and stopped. If anyone has any information about arson or anti-social behaviour in their area, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or the Police on 101.

Put simply, it's a door that is designed to stop a fire spreading to other parts of the building. Coupled with other measures such as smoke alarms it should allow those inside the building to reach safety. Click on the link for further information on fire door accessories as well as some great prices on a huge range of ultra-stylish fire doors. - Keep the wax pool clear of wick trimmings, matches and debris at all times. - Burn candles in a well-ventilated room, but avoid drafts, vents or air currents. This will help prevent rapid or uneven burning, sooting, and excessive dripping. - Trim the wick to inch each time before burning. Long or crooked wicks can cause uneven burning, dripping or flaring. - Dont move candles once they are lit. - Follow the manufacturer's recommendations on burn time and proper use. - Do not burn several candles close together as this might cause flaring (mainly with tea-lights). - Use a snuffer or a spoon to put out candles. Its safer than blowing them out when sparks can fly. For the original version including any supplementary images or video, visit http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/news/Candles_set_the_mood_not_a_fire/",

Awards were presented by local dignitaries including HM Lord-Lieutenant for Gloucestershire Dame Janet Trotter, Gloucestershire County Council cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure Cllr Will Windsor-Clive and chair of the county council Cllr Tony Hicks. Gloucestershire's Chief Fire Officer Jon Hall said: \"Everyone in this room is someone who has inspired heroism and excellence. We are incredibly proud of everything achieved in this community and these awards are to recognise the fact that so many of you have given your time and energy for others' benefit without seeking reward.\" \"More than that, this is one of the few opportunities we get to thank those friends, families and loved ones who support what we do. This is about feeling proud of everyone who makes this service what it is.\" Among those in the community to receive awards were: Glyn Jones and his daughter Ellie, from Stroud, who heroically pulled a man from his crashed car on the B4226 seconds before it exploded. Jan Wildman, from Hucclecote, who has campaigned tirelessly to improve road safety following the death of her 13-year-old daughter Cassie in a road collision just a few hundred metres from the family home. Jan is founding member of Gloucestershire charity Time and Place and has led local projects to change drivers' attitudes to speeding, drink driving, wearing seatbelts and using mobile phones while driving.

Crew to end on-call scheduling for workers in New York - Yahoo News Puskar) ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's attorney general says J. Crew has agreed to end on-call scheduling at stores nationwide. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says Friday the retailer will provide scheduling a week in advance. In April, Schneiderman's office wrote to 13 retailers questioning the practice of keeping workers on call for shifts on short notice. His office also cited possible violations of New York's requirement to pay hourly staff for at least four hours when they report for work. In a letter, J. Crew says on-call shifts helped deal with unexpected staff absences, but it ended them this month and will fill needed slots on a voluntary basis. It follows agreements with Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap Inc.

But national statistics show that December is the worst month of the year for accidental fires in the home, with 20 people a day either killed or injured across the country. Many people are unaware of the potential fire hazards and toxic threats that can lurk in fairy lights, candles and flammable Christmas decorations. With many people enjoying a Christmas drink and relaxing with family, it's easy to get distracted, just when you need to be at your most vigilant. Geoff Sallis, deputy chief fire officer, said: \"Fire safety is important all year round, but in December there are added risks whether from unsafe decorations or simply being distracted when the celebrations begin.\" \"By following very simple advice, everyone can be assured of a peaceful and safe Christmas.\" Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"Christmas can be a busy time for many people, but it can be a busy time for fire crews as well. We want to make sure that local people do everything they can to stay safe and have a very happy Christmas.\" Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service offers the following advice: Ensure you have a working smoke alarm installed on all levels of your home. Test your alarms weekly and never remove batteries to power presents. Never leave cooking unattended and avoid cooking after drinking alcohol. The majority of fires start in the kitchen. Always turn off kitchen appliances when you have finished cooking. For the original version including any supplementary images or video, visit http://www.glosfire.gov.uk/news_2013_12_24_xmas.html",

         "description" : "In support of the week, fire crews will be working with solid fuel providers in their local area and asking them to pass on the Services Heat Your Home Safely leaflets to their customers. The leaflets contain advice on ensuring that flues, chimneys and log burners are maintained correctly. Newark and Sherwood Homes have also agreed to distribute the leaflets to all of their solid fuel tenants. A chimney fire hot-spotting leaflet will also be re-launched during Chimney Fire Safety Week, and will be given out in the immediate area where a chimney fire has taken place, giving advice and reassurance. Risk Reduction Officer Ruth Clayton said: In recent years we have seen an increase in the number of chimney fires in the north of Nottinghamshire. Most of these are due to the build-up of debris in the chimney and could have been avoided had the chimneys been swept regularly. Fires of this nature can smoulder undetected for some time and present serious risk to your home and your family. When fire takes hold in a chimney the bricks in the roof space can become very hot - hot enough to start a smouldering fire that can set light to any combustible material placed near it. Effectively, what you store in your roof could become fuel for a larger fire. Chimney Fire Safety Week gives us the opportunity to highlight these issues to people and give them advice on maintenance as they start to think about using solid fuel sources of heating for the first time after the summer months. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service has the following advice for users of solid fuel: Have your chimney swept at least once a year - more frequently if you burn wood. Avoid storing too much in the roof space of your home, especially near the chimney breast, as this can be a potentially serious fire hazard. Make sure any appliance that burns fossil fuels, such as gas, coal, wood or oil is regularly maintained and serviced faulty appliances can result in carbon monoxide escaping, putting you and your family at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Consider having a carbon monoxide detector fitted as an additional safeguard against the build-up of poisonous fumes.

The normal rating for domestic premises is FD30, offering 30 minutes resistance to fire. You'll find a huge range of fire doors, many with free UK delivery on http://www.buyfiredoors.co.uk According to James Robson of the Manchester Evening News, in regards to Ronaldo: \"United would be prepared to break the world transfer record for a man on the verge of turning 31 for more than just what he can offer on the pitch.\" Robson expands, saying United's virtually unrivalled global standing allows them to significantly raise the profilesand resulting commercial revenuesof the players they sign. Therefore, a deal for Ronaldo or Neymar would see them form a symbiotic relationshipUnited would receive a marquee player who can significantly improve them on the pitch and generate merchandise sales off it, while the player himself would benefit significantly from a higher status and the privileges and financial rewards that entails. Manu Fernandez/Associated Press According to Robson, Red Devils executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward told investors, \"We believe the impact on player profiles around the world by joining Manchester United is very powerful,\" and the evidence is there. Robson notes that United players Memphis Depay and Bastian Schweinsteiger are third and fourth highest shirt-sellers respectively with retailer Kitbagthe latter climbing 27 places in the summer upon signing for the Red Devils. Who would be a better signing? Ronaldo 72.4% Total votes: 7,055 The report indicates that seventh-placed Neymar will hope to join the Portuguese superstar and Lionel Messi in the top-ranked spots, and that is something United \"can exploit,\" while similarly, Ronaldo's desire to leapfrog Messi into first could tempt him into rejoining his old club. Ronaldo has recorded 13 goals in all competitions this season, but his struggles to live up to his usual standard and his failure to net in 10 of his 17 appearances has seen talk emerge in some quarters that the forward is in decline. Football journalist Rafael Hernandez is one such voice, and he expects the 30-year-old to leave the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season: Hes playing like a man that doesnt want to be there, and now became a clear liability for Real Madrid. Will certainly be gone this summer. Rafael Hernandez (@RafaelH117) November 21, 2015 Nevertheless, Hernandez concedes he has \"a hundred or two hundred goals in him.\" Further, Ronaldo remains one of the global icons of the sport, and if he should return to Unitedwhere he is already belovedhis capture would have a significant commercial impact and equally improve the team.

The event marked the launch of a new initiative in Nottinghamshire which aims to educate and challenge new learner drivers about their risk of being involved in a crash. The Honest Truth initiative sees Nottinghamshire Road Safety Partnership working closely with local approved driving instructors who engage with their students on a range of risk factors including speeding, using a mobile phone while behind the wheel, not wearing seatbelts and driving while under the influence of drink or drugs. The initiative aims to change attitudes and behaviours around driving, particularly in young or new drivers, to reduce the number of incidents on our roads. Nottingham City Station Manager Dave Stevenson said: The 17-24 age group makes up just 10 per cent of the population, yet they account for half the number of injuries sustained in road traffic collisions between the hours of 10 pm and 5 am. We want to protect all drivers on our roads, but by targeting young or inexperienced drivers through their driving instructors we can ensure that they are receiving the right messages at the right time in their driving career, and hopefully those messages will stay with them for the rest of their lives. As well as real life case studies, The Honest Truth uses a series of animal personalities to demonstrate the dangers to young road users. The cheetah illustrates that its better to arrive five minutes late instead of dead on time, while the parrot warns of the dangers of talking or texting on a mobile phone while driving. Other animals including the rhino, chimp and peacock are used to highlight the hazards associated with not wearing seatbelts, being distracted while driving or showing off in front of friends while behind the wheel. Notts County Captain Dean Leacock said: This is obviously an important issue and its important that we get the message across to our fan-base, particularly the younger drivers that there are a number of risks whilst on the road. Hopefully by being involved in this demonstration we can get the point across to the wider community and help make the Nottinghamshire roads safer.

Chelsea's French defender Kurt Zouma led a rendition of the anthem at Stamford Bridge where a huge French flag was also displayed before the champions ended a run of three successive league defeats with victory over Norwich City thanks to a second-half goal from Diego Costa. That lifted Chelsea up one place to 15th on 14 points, but still a long way behind the leaders. Leicester top the table with 28 points from 13 matches, followed by Manchester United on 27 and Manchester City and Arsenal on 26. City will reclaim first place if they beat Liverpool in the late match at the Etihad Stadium. While Vardy equalled Ruud van Nistelrooy's 12-year-old scoring record, Leonardo Ulloa and Shinji Okazaki also scored for Leicester. Claudio Ranieri's side stayed above Manchester United, who won 2-1 at Watford and were briefly top after a dramatic finale at Vicarage Road. United led 1-0 following an 11th minute volley from Memphis Depay before Troy Deeney equalised with an 87th-minute penalty but then scored an own goal in stoppage time to give United victory. Arsenal slipped back to fourth after losing 2-1 at West Bromwich Albion where Mikel Arteta put through his own net and Santi Cazorla missed a penalty, while Aston Villa stayed nailed to the bottom after losing 4-0 at Everton.

The 10 and 11 year-olds will also learn about the hazards they face in everyday life and what to do if an accident occurs. Seven different real-life scenarios that highlight potential dangers will be set up in the community fire station. Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service will be promoting bonfire and firework safety and discussing burns and scalds in an interactive and fun scenario. The children will also be shown video clips and photographs of real life incidents where children have been burned. They will learn about the consequences of such incidents and the impact they can have on themselves, the local environment and the fire and rescue service. Street pastors will be discussing with the children how anti-social behaviour impacts on their community and the benefits of having an ICE contact in their mobile phone. Other workshops will be delivered by the public health school nurses, Nexus, Northern Power Grid and the RNLI. At the end of each session, pupils will have the chance to ask questions and receive a Crucial Crew pack containing further resources, activities and information. The week-long event has been organised by the North Tyneside Child Accident Prevention (CAP) Strategy Group; a multi-agency task force and part of the Local Safeguarding Children Board. District Manager for North Tyneside Graeme Hurst, Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service, said: \"Sadly accidents are one of the biggest causes of fatalities amongst children and, by their very nature, can be prevented. We can't wrap children up in cotton wool, so its important they learn how to stay safe. By working with our partners we are able to highlight the various dangers, including fire, and promote ways of how they can stay safe.

Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy expressed gratitude to Ruud van Nistelrooy after equalling the Dutchman's record of scoring in 10 successive Premier League games on Saturday. Vardy grabbed the opener with a crisp finish as Leicester cruised to a 3-0 win at Newcastle United - a result which took Claudio Ranieri's men to the top of the table, although they can be overtaken by Manchester City if they beat Liverpool in the late kick-off. Van Nistelrooy took to social media on Friday to wish Vardy well - a gesture that meant a lot to the former Fleetwood Town man. \"I kept getting it [the message] sent to me and fair play to him for doing it. He didn't have to do that,\" Vardy told Sky Sports News. Vardy can now better the mark of Van Nistelrooy - who set the record in 2003 during his time at Manchester United - if he scores for Leicester at Old Trafford next weekend. \"We'll have to wait and see. We need to get back on the training field, work on some plans and then put them into action,\" added Vardy, who was happier talking about Leicester's impressive win against a dismal Newcastle side.

You will also find a huge selection of modern, stylish fire doors which are all available at great, online prices Fire officers joined Northumbria Police in warning that anyone caught assaulting firefighters will be investigated and prosecuted. The warning comes after youths threw bottles and other objects at firefighters tackling a fire in a wheelie bin at a skate park in Blakelaw, Newcastle, last Saturday night. One firefighter was struck five times by the missiles and suffered a minor injury. Assistant Chief Fire Officer at TWFRS Chris Lowther said: We will not tolerate any verbal or physical attacks on our staff. Thankfully our firefighter was not seriously injured in the incident in Blakelaw but throwing objects at our crews clearly has the potential to cause serious harm. That is totally unacceptable and we will work with our partners in the police to ensure the people responsible are brought to justice. Attacks on crews not only hinder them from fulfilling their role to make our communities safe but also risk putting emergency equipment out of action which could be needed to save a life at any time. The safety of our firefighters is of primary importance, and whilst attacks on our staff are rare, we will do everything to protect our staff and have CCTV fitted to every fire appliance. We will use this evidence for prosecutions of anyone who targets our staff. Northumbria Police Chief Inspector Steve Hails said: \"Firefighters are there to save lives and it's appalling that they should face being attacked while doing their job and trying to help the public. \"We won't put up with those that think it's acceptable to target fire fighters in this way and it's important they get the message that what they are doing is thoughtless, dangerous and could cost lives. \"I'd urge anyone involved in such behaviour to think twice about the consequences of their actions, they could end up hurting someone and if caught they could end up with a criminal record all because of something they probably see as a prank.

         "description" : "Egg Run Success! Thursday 17 April 2014 Dozens of disadvantaged children and those with additional needs in Nottinghamshire will have a smile on their face this Easter thanks to bikers who took part in this years Nottinghamshire Easter Egg Run. More than 600 motorbikes joined the convoy from The Forest Recreation Ground in Nottingham for the ride along the A60 to Mansfield Fire Station on Sunday (13 April) where they donated 1,670 Easter eggs and raised 480. The eggs will be distributed to children across the county via Surestart centres and childrens homes, and to those children with special needs or living with foster parents. The money will go towards providing additional help for children suffering from disabilities or other hardship. This was the 34th Nottinghamshire Easter Egg Run and the eighth consecutive time it has been hosted by Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service. As well as benefiting hundreds of children across the county, the event offers the opportunity for bikers from Nottinghamshire and beyond to get together, share a cuppa and visit some of the trade stands on offer on the day. It also gives firefighters the chance to deliver some important road safety messages to those taking part. Chief Fire Officer John Buckley, himself a keen motorcyclist, said: The Egg Run has become an important date in the fire services calendar in Nottinghamshire and we are always impressed at the number of people who turn out to support it. The events success is all down to the bikers that come in their hundreds to donate Easter eggs to help bring a smile to the faces of some of the countys less fortunate children. I extend my sincere thanks to them once again for helping to keep the tradition alive, as well as helping to promote safe riding and reducing the number of incidents involving motorcycles on our roads. It is hoped that next years Nottinghamshire Easter Egg Run will take place on Sunday 29 March, which is the Sunday before Easter weekend.

The event marked the launch of a new initiative in Nottinghamshire which aims to educate and challenge new learner drivers about their risk of being involved in a crash. The Honest Truth initiative sees Nottinghamshire Road Safety Partnership working closely with local approved driving instructors who engage with their students on a range of risk factors including speeding, using a mobile phone while behind the wheel, not wearing seatbelts and driving while under the influence of drink or drugs. The initiative aims to change attitudes and behaviours around driving, particularly in young or new drivers, to reduce the number of incidents on our roads. Nottingham City Station Manager Dave Stevenson said: The 17-24 age group makes up just 10 per cent of the population, yet they account for half the number of injuries sustained in road traffic collisions between the hours of 10 pm and 5 am. We want to protect all drivers on our roads, but by targeting young or inexperienced drivers through their driving instructors we can ensure that they are receiving the right messages at the right time in their driving career, and hopefully those messages will stay with them for the rest of their lives. As well as real life case studies, The Honest Truth uses a series of animal personalities to demonstrate the dangers to young road users. The cheetah illustrates that its better to arrive five minutes late instead of dead on time, while the parrot warns of the dangers of talking or texting on a mobile phone while driving. Other animals including the rhino, chimp and peacock are used to highlight the hazards associated with not wearing seatbelts, being distracted while driving or showing off in front of friends while behind the wheel. Notts County Captain Dean Leacock said: This is obviously an important issue and its important that we get the message across to our fan-base, particularly the younger drivers that there are a number of risks whilst on the road. Hopefully by being involved in this demonstration we can get the point across to the wider community and help make the Nottinghamshire roads safer. The whole club are backing the Honest Truth campaign and hopefully we can do our bit to reduce the number of accidents across the county. SM Stevenson added: We are extremely grateful to Notts County Football Club and its players for supporting this initiative and we hope this will be the start of many community projects that the Club and Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service can work on together, for the benefit of others.

         "description" : "The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) balloted its members for industrial action over national pension arrangements, with a strike date now planned for Wednesday 25th September from noon to 4pm. Although the dispute is outside the control of Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service, some firefighters in the county are members of the FBU and could support the strike. During the industrial action, a reduced emergency response service will be provided, but local people and businesses are being assured that a significant contingency plan is in place to offer them the best protection possible. Chief Fire Officer Jon Hall said: \"Our planning assumption is that some of our fire stations won't be operational during the proposed action. But we have substantial contingency plans in place with the majority of our retained fire stations due to be operational and non-striking staff based at further back-up stations in the county.\" \"We want to reassure local people that, for those staff that aren't part of the strike, it's business as usual. As ever, we will endeavour to ensure people get the fire and rescue service they deserve.\" The contingency plan may mean a slightly less speedy response to some areas, and residents are being reminded of the importance of keeping their own homes safe from fire. More information can be found at www.glosfire.gov.uk or www.direct.gov.uk/firekills Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"This is a national strike and not one we can do anything about, however we can make sure that the county is fully prepared and that's why very thorough plans are in place for the period being discussed.\" \"We ask that families do everything they can to make sure they're safe in their own homes. It is as important as ever that people are aware of how best to stay safe from fires and what to do in case of an emergency.\" Residents are also being encouraged to avoid making unnecessary 999 calls. During times of industrial action the priority for crews is those incidents where a life is at risk or someone needs to be rescued. More than ever, it is important people only call the emergency number if they really need a fire engine. Further arrangements have been made for potential large-scale incidents, including sharing resources of neighbouring services.

When she realizedthe Hudson Party Store that had gone out of business was still filled with inventory, she got the idea to buy and donate them all to charity. She says she donates toys anonymously every year, but her efforts this year have drawn national attention. \"When I saw this toy store, I just realized I could do it on a grander scale for this one year,\" Ms. Suchman hold the Houston-based ABC 13 News . \"We talked and negotiated and bought the entire toy store.\" Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/20 \"I emailed [Mr. Rodriguez] and said 'I just bought a toy store, can you help?'\" Suchman told Today.com . \"He got right back to me and laughed and said, 'No one has ever said that before.'\" The donations, numbering in their thousands and including toys, stuffed animals, and school supplies, were boxed up and shipped to the citys Department of Homeless Services. The donations arrived in time to be distributed this holiday season. \"I've been doing this for many years and we have many generous sponsors,\" Rodriquez told ABC 13 News. \"But I have to say that this is the first time anybody ever bought out an entire store and donated to the children of shelters.\" Suchman's family started a tech company in New York that became a success and she has chosen to share that financial success with needy children. The mother of three has preferred to remain anonymous in the past,she agreed to allow her name to be released after Mr. Rodriguez told her \"one story often inspires others to take actions.\" She declined to reveal how much she paid for the lot of toys, but has plans to attend at least one of the shelters where her toys are being distributed, according to Today.com. \"I know everyone can use a gift around the holidays,\" Suchman told NY 1 News .

Through research NFRS officers have identified hotspots within the county. Naseem Begum, Partnerships Support Officer for BME and New Emerging Communities and organiser of the event said: We have been working very closely with members of the Pakistani community to get an understanding of the concerns they have. For the past two years I have been doing a lot of research into BME communities and emerging communities. My research has shown that these communities are vulnerable to the risk of accidental and deliberate fires. We want to educate this community and instil a sense of confidence.

         "description" : "Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service (GFRS) has unveiled the new unit at the award-winning Gloucestershire Water Rescue Centre - replacing a previous smaller vehicle. The all-wheel drive vehicle is designed to tow the county's rescue boats and carry equipment used in responding to water rescue incidents. This includes a mud rescue platform, rescue sled and drysuits. The unit also includes changing and decontamination facilities and a side awning for shelter in bad weather. Following the Gloucestershire floods in 2007, one of the main objectives of the service's Integrated Risk Management Plan (IRMP) was to further improve the county's water rescue response - something the new vehicle addresses. Deputy Chief Fire Officer Geoff Sallis said: \"The 2007 floods were a great learning experience for the service and we've used these lessons to ensure we are even better prepared to handle water rescues should we be called upon.\" \"A key element of this response is making sure we have the right equipment for the job; the rescue crews at Tewkesbury played a major role in the design and functionality of the vehicle. The result is a state-of-the-art vehicle, which will improve our response capability at water rescue incidents.\" Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"I'm delighted that this new vehicle has been introduced to our rescue fleet. With the expertise we already have in our water rescue teams, this unit is a great addition to our already excellent fire service, making it more responsive and efficient.\" ENDS Notes to Editors Firefighters at Tewkesbury were consulted on the design specification of the vehicle and they played a major part in configuring the internal layout and functionality for water rescue incidents. Gloucestershire Water Rescue Centre opened in 2011 as a joint project between GFRS and voluntary organisation Severn Area Rescue Association (SARA). The centre was shortlisted for the 4th annual iESE Awards 2013, held in London on 6th March, in the category of Fire and Rescue Project of the Year - coming third overall.

         "description" : "The Iranian Army Ground Force has rolled out seven new completely indigenous and high-tech military achievements, including a robot that can carry light to semi-heavy weaponry. The achievements were unveiled on Sunday in the presence of the force's Commander Brigadier General Kioumars Heydari, and Commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army Aviation, Second Brigadier General Yousef Qorbani. The robot has been named Caracal after a type of wild cat that can be found in parts of Iran. The automaton, which has been designed for ground warfare, has a top speed of 30 kilometers (18 miles) per hour, and has an operating range that exceeds 500 meters (0.3 mile). Caracal is equipped with an independent suspension system, smart remote control mechanism, laser rangefinder and an optical system. The ceremony also wheeled out Hadaf (Goal)-2, a new missile launcher with a canister capable of holding and firing two missiles at the same time. The launcher can be used for rapid deployment purposes and is fitted with an automatic leveler that can help it identify the best possible location for deployment. The Ground Force also inaugurated the Gohar (Gem) 4WD vehicle that is empowered to carry as much as 500 kilograms (1102 lb) off-road, and travel as far as 700 kilometers (434 miles) at a maximum speed of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour. Gohar can also travel across 70-grade lengthwise and 35-grade edgewise slopes and wade into waters that run 80 centimeters deep. Chabok (Agile), an extremely fast frequency shuffling system, was another item that was put on display during the event. The apparatus provides a highly secure link among ground and airborne communication devices by changing the frequencies traveling between them at a 200,000-per-second rate, thus blocking all radar jamming attempts by the enemy. The ceremony also featured unveiling of piston engines for drones with capacities ranging from 40 to 400 milliliters. At the former capacity, the engines can fly a 30-kilogram (66-lb) drone. A relief and rescue robot dubbed Masih (Messiah) and a new tank carrier were also exhibited at the event. The Ground Force's commander hailed Messiah as a remarkable helping hand for the military's medical staff, who are busy fighting the new coronavirus pandemic.",

         "description" : "Firefighters from both Tyne and Wear and Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Services set up the gruelling StrongArm Challenge in memory of former Tyne and Wear firefighter Peter Metcalfe, who died in 2012 aged 35. The first StrongArm took place in Scotland in 2013 and last year the original team, along with several new faces, returned for a new challenge in the Lake District. On consecutive days they swam eight miles in Ullswater, completed a mountain triathlon and took part in the Total Warrior 10-mile assault course, carrying a paraplegic team member, before cycling 100 miles home. So far they have raised about 60,000 for the national Firefighters Charity and the Make a Wish Foundation. The Firefighters Charity, which provides support and rehabilitation services, named the StrongArm Challenge as its Team of the Year at the annual Spirit of Fire Awards in London on Friday. (October 2) The award was presented by BBC newsreader Nicholas Owen. Watch Manager Paul Thompson, Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service, said: When our colleague and dear friend Peter Metcalfe tragically lost his life suddenly to stomach cancer, we wanted to create a very special event to keep his spirit alive and raise funds in his memory. \"Thanks to all the organisational work by people like Carl Stephenson and Peter's brother, Warren, it has been a bigger success than we could have wished for. And winning the Spirit of Fire award is a great honour for everyone involved.\" Warren Metcalfe, who has taken part in and helped to organise the challenge events, is a firefighter with County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service.

         "description" : "\r\n\r\nIverheal 6 is a medication that has gained popularity in recent years due to its efficacy in treating various parasitic infections. This comprehensive guide aims to provide a detailed understanding of Iverheal 6, including its uses, benefits, potential side effects, and more. Whether you're a medical professional or a curious individual looking for information, this article is tailored to suit a larger audience.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Iverheal 6\r\n\r\nIverheal 6, an antiparasitic medication, is a member of the avermectin class of drugs. It contains 6mg of Ivermectin as its active ingredient, making it a valuable tool in combating parasitic infections. This medication is available in the form of oral tablets and is used to treat a variety of parasitic infestations, including strongyloidiasis, onchocerciasis, and scabies. It works by paralyzing and killing the parasites responsible for these conditions.\r\n\r\nKey Uses of Iverheal 6\r\n\r\nStrongyloidiasis Treatment:\r\n\r\nIverheal 6 is highly effective in treating strongyloidiasis, a parasitic infection caused by the nematode worm Strongyloides stercoralis. This condition often goes unnoticed for an extended period, making the accurate diagnosis and treatment with Iverheal 6 crucial.\r\nOnchocerciasis Eradication:\r\n\r\nOnchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, is a debilitating disease caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus.

         "description" : "Personal Finance Is Your Friend When Treated Right No magic is needed to successfully handle your personal finances. A bit of common sense and money management will let you make the most of your income and make more money as well. To be successful, you have to be good at managing money. Always protect profit as well as any invested capital. Investing your current profits to grow them is a good idea, but you have to have good money management skills to make that work. Make sure you have a barrier set to determine what you shall call profit and what will be capital. Keep a small envelope in your wallet or purse. This envelope can be used to keep track of receipts and small documents. This will make it easier to keep a hold of them and record them. It's useful to have your receipts if you ever see double charges for a purchase on your credit card statement. Typically owning two to four credit cards that you regularly use and pay off will help keep your credit score high. Having just one card will make it longer for you to get a better credit score, while five or more cards can make it harder to deal with finances. Begin with two cards, then add additional cards as necessary to build your credit. Be aware of your finances by making detailed arrangements for your financial stability. This plan will encourage you to stay on track, and stop you when you become a spendthrift. The largest purchases that you will probably ever make in your lifetime are your home and vehicle. Your monthly payments on these items, including interest, usually makes up the biggest chunk of your budget. Try to pay them off quickly by making extra payments or applying your tax refund toward the principal. If you're one half of a married couple, the partner who has the strongest credit should be the one to apply for a loan. If you're suffering from bad credit, building it can be done by getting a card that you can pay on time. Keep working on restoring the credit of both spouses so that your financial liabilities can be equally shared. Use compact florescent bulbs in place of incandescent bulbs where you can. If you replace these older bulbs, you should notice lowered energy bills and a reduced carbon footprint. CFL bulbs last a lot longer than old-style, traditional light bulbs. The need to purchase fewer bulbs will save you money. Switch to a free checking account. Go to your local banks or look into credit unions or online banks. Perhaps the most effective way to avoid jeopardizing your current financial situation is to avoid incurring credit card debt. Before you buy anything with your credit card, ask yourself a few questions. Think about how long you'll be paying it off. If you can't pay off the charge in a month, and it's something you don't really need, avoid it. As you have learned, any person can control their expenses, grow their assets, and gain the fit and happy financial life they dream of. You have to come up with a plan to reduce debt and save money by coming up with a budget.

         "description" : "Personal Finance Tips That Will Truly Work If you haven't been doing it, taking care of neglected finances is a difficult job. If you're knowledgeable about them, though, it can be made easier. Here is some advice that can help you in straightening out your finances. Honesty and trust are key attributes to look for when you are shopping for a broker. Verify that they have great references and make sure they are honest and upfront with you. Your level of financial knowledge plays a role in your selection, too. Try finding the best local restaurants that the locals eat to find more authentic food and better prices in foreign countries. You will want to eat at local restaurants, instead of in overpriced tourists areas and hotels. You can actually find food that is cheaper and tastes better. Debt should be your last resort, because debt can lead to poor personal finances. Some debt is unavoidable; however, if you can avoid those sources of debt that are problematic, like credit cards, you will save yourself headaches later. You will lose less money to interest and possible fees if you borrow less money. Being patient about your finances will help you. It is quite tempting to run out and purchase the newest electronics on offer. If they would just be patient and wait a bit, those prices will go down by up to 50%. This, in turn, frees up additional cash that can be spent on other items. It is important that you establish some structure to ensure the security of your financial future. It can be quite motivating to form a financial plan, as it provides you with concrete reasons for working harder, saving and avoiding needless spending. A yard sale is a great way to get rid of old items while earning you some extra cash. You may even be able to convince your neighbors to contribute unused items, having you sell them for a small cut of the selling price. With a little creativity, your sale can be the talk of the town! Use compact florescent bulbs in place of incandescent bulbs where you can. Replacing your bulbs will cost more initially, but you will see greater savings in the long run and do your part to help the environment. CFL blubs were specially made to last a much longer period of time than a normal bulb would. You will spend less money by buying fewer bulbs. Credit cards are a fantastic alternative to using a debit card. If you get approved for a credit card, stick to using it on essential items, such as groceries and gas for your car. Look into your credit card provider's rewards program to see if there are potential benefits for you. If you want your property to stay under control, pay attention to your cash flow. Track both income and expenses, and assess property performance at the end of each month. Establish a solid property budget that you can use as a guideline. You can avoid splurging and spending your savings if you allocate a cash allowance for yourself. Buy some food you enjoy, some new clothes but do not spend more than this small allowance on personal items. This will allow you to enjoy some fun stuff and not blow your entire budget. Schedule a transfer from your checking account to a high interest plan so that part of your paycheck is put aside regularly. This may take some getting used to, but soon, you will look at it like any other bill you pay on time and the increase in your savings will be well worth it. Again, dealing with your personal finances can be extremely stressful. By becoming educated on managing your finances, some of the burden can be lifted from you shoulders. The information in the above article is provided to help you understand the steps you can take to improve your financial situation.

         "description" : "Its also a good opportunity to remind existing staff of the importance of fire safety. This years message for businesses is Keep it SIMPLE and Safe and offers the following SIMPLE reminders: Store stock safely: keep corridors, stairs and exits clear Identify alarm points so you can warn others Make sure doors are closed to stop fires from spreading Place things that catch fire away from things that cause fire Let someone know if you spot fire safety problems Ensure everyone knows what to do if a fire alarm sounds Helping businesses to manage their fire risks and hazards, and potentially to save lives and safeguard their businesses against financial and commercial loss is of key importance, particularly in these competitive times when growth and sustainability are a priority. Fire can cause major disruption for businesses there is a far greater chance of recovery if risks have been identified, and appropriate arrangements have been put in place to prevent fires starting, or to mitigate their impact. Statistics show that in 2013/14 alone, there were 2,139 fires in industrial premises, 5,561 fires in commercial/retail, and 1,898 fires in schools, higher/further education and health/hospital premises. Throughout the week Cleveland Fire Brigade will join other fire and rescue services across the country to hold a range of events and activities to engage with businesses in their communities, working with them to help improve their knowledge of fire safety. In Teesside, businesses will be visited by the Brigade who will offer fire safety advice, help identify appropriate training courses or suggest a fire safety audit is undertaken. The brigade can also take enforcement action where appropriate. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection at Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: We would encourage all businesses to ensure their staff are fully aware of potential fire risks and hazards, and know what to do in an emergency. Fires can devastate businesses resulting in long-term consequences for employers and employees but there are simple measures that can be taken to prevent fires occurring. Peter Dartford, CFOA President, added: UK Business Safety Weeks message may be a SIMPLE one, but its essential that businesses consider fire risks in their organisations, and make sure that their employees are aware of the causes and consequences of fire. Fire services work closely with businesses, helping them to effectively manage their fire risks, safeguarding their staff, premises, stock and potentially their livelihood. Keep it simple and keep your business safe. Notes to editors: About CFOA 1.The Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) is a professional membership association and a registered charity.

Steve McClaren's side were unable to raise themselves as frustration grew in the stands, boos ringing out at the final whistle after Okazaki pounced following Elliot's save from Marc Albrighton . It leaves Newcastle hovering one point above the bottom three, while Claudio Ranieri's side climb to the summit above Manchester United . Having passed a late fitness test prior to kick-off, Vardy was presented with an early chance to equal Van Nistelrooy's record after six minutes. Newcastle unchanged from their 1-0 win over Bournemouth failed to deal with an Albrighton corner and the loose ball dropped to the England international, but his effort was well blocked. Leicester were making all the running in the opening minutes and a swift counter-attack from Riyad Mahrez created an opening for Ulloa in for Jeff Schlupp as Ranieri's only change however Vurnon Anita made a crucial interception before the striker could tap home from close range. The hosts who lost Cheick Tiote to a groin injury after 20 minutes struggled to create anything in attack, Ayoze Perez blazing their best chance over the crossbar. Eventually Leicester's pressure told as Vardy's latest milestone moment came in first-half stoppage time, the 28-year-old drifting past Sissoko before rifling past Elliot. McClaren's attempts to cajole Newcastle at the break initially had the desired impact, but they slowly lost any momentum and allowed Leicester to control proceedings. The pace of Vardy and Mahrez were a constant threat and, after a number of wasted chances, Vardy rattled the crossbar. Weak defending from Chancel Mbemba allowed him a free shot at goal but the woodwork came to Elliot's rescue. Newcastle failed to heed that warning and Ulloa doubled the away team's advantage just after the hour with his first of the campaign, the striker left unmarked at the back post to head home Mahrez's pinpoint cross.

Where appropriate, they will arrange free boiler repairs or replacement. The launch comes as fire brigades across the country together with NHS England, Public Health England, Age UK and the Local Government Association pledge to tackle health and social problems together to try and reduce the number of winter hospital admissions and winter deaths. The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of the dangers faced by people struggling to keep warm over the winter months and provide emergency assistance and help with longer-term solutions. Last years campaign helped over 700 people and included lending out 449 electric heaters and 109 thermal blankets as well as handing out 60 food parcels. Phil Lancaster, the Brigades Director of Community Protection, said: Being able to keep warm at home during the winter months can literally be a matter of life and death. Nobody should be in that position and be cold this winter because there is lots of help and support available. Stay Safe and Warm is available to anyone who is struggling. Its free and theres no means testing, eligibility criteria or age restrictions. Anyone who is worried that they might not be able to heat their home properly or is concerned about a family member, friend or neighbour should call the Stay Safe and Warm team straight away please dont delay, do it today as it could save someones life. A typical Stay Safe and Warm referral last year resulted in agencies visiting a Cleveland resident in her own home who had multiple health problems. Her boiler had broken and the elderly lady was unable to fund the repairs. Fire doors are supplied in a range of ratings that indicate the length of time that the door can resist fire and heat.

Firefighters test new thermal imaging cameras in training exercise in Basildon Firefighters at Essex County Fire and Rescue Service have tested the latest high-tech thermal imaging cameras during a high rise training exercise in Basildon. Crews from Basildon, Orsett, Billericay, Rayleigh, Wickford, Grays and Chelmsford Fire Stations took part in Exercise Ketling in multi-storey building in Southernhay, Basildon on November 20. The exercise gave firefighters the opportunity to test the latest ISG thermal imaging cameras, which will be used by frontline crews across the County. The cameras allow firefighters to search for people trapped in smoke filled rooms and find hot-spots which could be hidden behind a wall or in a roof space. These cameras are life savers, they are vital in helping find casualties when visibility is restricted because of smoke and darkness. Sub Officer Dan Evison from Basildon Fire Station organised the exercise, he said: Exercise Kelting was an excellent and rare opportunity for firefighters to train for a fire in a high rise building. Because of the location of the fire, crews had a physically demanding task to get the firefighting equipment up several floors before they then had to search the heavily smoke logged rooms to rescue casualties.

Click on the link for more information on cheap glass fire doors. You will also find a huge selection of modern, stylish fire doors which are all available at great, online prices Dont fuel their fire thats the message from Cleveland Fire Brigade and its partners who are urging residents to help tackle rubbish fires this bonfire season. The Brigade, along with Cleveland Police and Redcar & Cleveland Council is encouraging all residents to keep their bins secure and out of sight to avoid them becoming a target for arsonists. Last year there were 214 deliberate fires across Cleveland over the bonfire period 15 October to 12 November costing the local community nearly half a million pounds. Redcar & Cleveland saw a 20 per cent increase in deliberate fires costing 126,000. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection at Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: We are urging residents to ensure they only put their bins out on the morning of collection and to bring them in as soon as possible to protect themselves and their property. Fires involving rubbish and bins can easily spread to your home, putting you at risk. To protect yourself, your family and your community, please follow our simple advice not just this bonfire season but all year round. Chief Superintendent Glenn Gudgeon from Cleveland Police, said: We have had several cases recently of bins being set on fire and then extended to premises, potentially putting lives at risk. A life sentence can be imposed on the offence of arrest with intent to endanger life and we dont want any young people sitting in prison for many years contemplating what was a stupid act of fun when they were young. Parents must also take responsibility for what their children are doing, where they are and who they are with. Equipping them with the knowledge around the dangers of starting fires will help to keep the whole community safe over the coming weeks. Councillor Helen McLuckie, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods at Redcar & Cleveland Council, added: In the lead up to bonfire night it is important that residents pay extra attention to how they store their wheelie bins and unwanted items, to help keep people safe and prevent anti-social behaviour. The most important step that anyone can take is to simply store bins away, ideally behind locked gates, especially at night and to make sure that rubbish does not pile up close to buildings.

See uncertainty in capital markets: British Land CEO Chris Grigg, CEO of British Land, says that capital market volatility has had an impact on the property sector. Russians made up just 1 per cent of buyers in the prime London areas, which also include Knightsbridge and Mayfair, in the first three-quarters of 2015, down from 7 per cent a year earlier. The fall has coincided with a period of turbulence in Chinese equity markets, which spread to other Asian emerging markets and prompted falls in the region's currencies against sterling. China's renminbi is down 6.6 per cent since April. In Russia, the war in Ukraine and international sanctions, together with lower oil prices, have taken a big toll on the country's economy and currency. The rouble has shed 25 per cent against sterling since April and is down 53 per cent over the past two years. More from the Financial Times: Review offers hope for older homebuyers \"These groups are not selling, but they are not buying either,\" said Charles McDowell, a Knightsbridge-based buying agent. Fionnuala Earley, residential research director at Hamptons, said: \"If you look at what's happening in the wider global economy, the trend makes sense although it may be a blip and they may ultimately come back.\" She said there were \"tentative\" signs that Asian owners were selling more prime London homes as a proportion of those on the market. This is the next big property investment The market for expensive UK homes has been affected by sweeping changes to the stamp duty regime announced last December, which cut tax for most buyers but increased it for those buying homes worth more than 937,000. This includes rates of 10 per cent on the portion of the sale price above 925,000 and 12 per cent on the part above 1.5m. Total transactions in prime London boroughs were down 19 per cent in the first three-quarters of 2015 against a year earlier, according to figures from LonRes, with agents blaming the stamp duty rise. UK nationals made up 42 per cent of buyers this year, against 36 per cent last year, Hamptons said, although relative demand from European Union countries remained strong.

Redcar & Cleveland saw a 20 per cent increase in deliberate fires costing 126,000. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection at Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: We are urging residents to ensure they only put their bins out on the morning of collection and to bring them in as soon as possible to protect themselves and their property. Fires involving rubbish and bins can easily spread to your home, putting you at risk. To protect yourself, your family and your community, please follow our simple advice not just this bonfire season but all year round. Chief Superintendent Glenn Gudgeon from Cleveland Police, said: We have had several cases recently of bins being set on fire and then extended to premises, potentially putting lives at risk. A life sentence can be imposed on the offence of arrest with intent to endanger life and we dont want any young people sitting in prison for many years contemplating what was a stupid act of fun when they were young. Parents must also take responsibility for what their children are doing, where they are and who they are with. Equipping them with the knowledge around the dangers of starting fires will help to keep the whole community safe over the coming weeks. Councillor Helen McLuckie, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods at Redcar & Cleveland Council, added: In the lead up to bonfire night it is important that residents pay extra attention to how they store their wheelie bins and unwanted items, to help keep people safe and prevent anti-social behaviour. The most important step that anyone can take is to simply store bins away, ideally behind locked gates, especially at night and to make sure that rubbish does not pile up close to buildings. We ask that bins are presented from 7am on the morning of collection and then brought back inside as soon as they can after they have been collected, and we would suggest by no later than 7pm. If anyone has any information about arson or anti-social behaviour in their area, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or the Police on 101.

Following this, we will join the march through the city centre, starting at the Civic Centre at 12pm, before providing people with fire and community safety advice at the main event in Park Lane from 1pm. Assistant Chief Fire Officer John Baines, who is also the Services Stonewall Diversity Champion, said: Taking a lead role in Sunderland Pride is a priority for the Service. It will once again be fantastic to join with our staff and the community to celebrate and strengthen our relationship with LGBT people from the North East and beyond.

That's 9.6% more than a year ago, and twice as much as anywhere else in the U.K. London is struggling with rising housing prices, making home ownership difficult or even impossible for many average Londoners. Median annual salary in the British capital was just over 34,000 ($52,106) last year, official data show. The population is growing rapidly -- it surpassed the pre-war record of 8.6 million people in February, and is expected to continue expanding. The population is forecast to reach 9 million by 2021 and 11 million by 2050. Developers are not able to keep up with the growing demand. Analysts say around 50,000 new homes need to be built in London to satisfy the demand. But data from London authorities show that less than half of that was built in both 2014 and 2013. An influx of foreign buyers is adding fuel to London's property boom, with Qatari, Chinese and Russian investors among the big spenders. London isn't the only global city becoming unaffordable. The average price of an apartment in Manhattan climbed to $998,000 in the third quarter -- a nearly 10% increase from a year ago, according to the latest report by real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman Real Estate.

We are reminding the public and in particular young people that unofficial bonfires are classed as arson and anyone found deliberately setting fires could end up with a criminal record. The Brigade will be working together with Cleveland Police and councils for the next four weeks on initiatives including patrolling hot-spot areas, school visits and removing bonfire rubbish. Ian Hayton, Chief Fire Officer said: These unofficial bonfires cause a nuisance to local people and ultimately cost the community money. They also tie up fire engines that should be undertaking vital life-saving prevention work or attending real emergencies. We want to be clear unofficial bonfires are classed as arson incidents. Not only could they lead to criminal records they are inherently dangerous. Rubbish fires can spread quickly and the consequences can be horrific for anyone caught in the flames, so please dont get involved in unofficial bonfires or let your children attend one. If you spot an unofficial bonfire being built please call us on 01429 872311 and we will work with local councils to remove the danger. Chief Superintendent Glenn Gudgeon of Cleveland Police added: We want the public to work with us to ensure those who are intent on causing criminal damage are reported to police. I am urging the public not to tolerate fire setting in their community and report any incidents immediately. We will be carrying out additional patrols over this busy period but hope the community will join us in ensuring those who do set out to cause wanton damage are reported and stopped.

England captain Eoin Morgan said his team had learnt from the mistakes of the last game. \"It's an excellent performance,\" he said. \"The important thing is that we learnt from the last game, particularly in batting.

         "description" : "Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) crews will now be helping to deliver life-saving care for cardiac arrest patients as part of a new joint initiative with North West Ambulance Service (NWAS). From today at 12pm, when a person dials 999 to report a suspected cardiac arrest (a condition where the heart stops pumping blood around the body because of a fatal abnormal heart rhythm), both North West Ambulance and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue will respond and whoever reaches the casualty first will start providing life-saving treatment before ambulance crews can take over. Once the patient has been stabilised, they will then be conveyed to hospital by ambulance. The scheme works in a similar way to the Trusts volunteer Community First Responder scheme, where trained members of the public are despatched to life-threatening emergency calls within their local community. The added advantage to despatching fire crews, is their ability to respond on blue lights therefore arriving more quickly to a situation where literally every second can mean the difference between life and death. Fire crews will be paged by NWAS when a suspected cardiac arrest is reported within three miles of the fire station and despatched at the same time as an ambulance. Once the ambulance crew arrives, advanced life support will commence and the patient will be handed into the care of NWAS. North West Ambulance Service, Director of Operations, Derek Cartwright comments: This is an extremely positive project and its great to work with GMFRS on a scheme that will contribute to saving lives here in the Greater Manchester. The chances of survival from cardiac arrest diminish rapidly with every passing second so the sooner someone can receive treatment, the greater their chances are of leading a full and healthy life afterwards. It doesnt matter who gives that treatment whether it is a member of the public, an ambulance crew or a fire crew so the more resources there are available to respond, the better for those who suffer this potentially devastating condition. Last year, the ambulance service responded to 5,486 incidents in Greater Manchester where the patient had suffered a cardiac arrest sadly, despite everyones best efforts, not everyone survives but everyone deserves that chance and this is what this scheme will give people.

Jamarlon Qdashus Edwards has been charged with one count of first degree robbery and one count of first degree theft of property in one case.Alabaster police confirm those charges are from a carjacking that happened in the parking lot of the Game Stop in Probst Promenade on Nov. 9. The victim, Tyler Parsons, said a red Challenger pulled up next to him and the passenger got out to speak to him about cars, but ended up stealing the car at gunpoint. Parsons said several people have swapped sports car stories with him since he got the car in May, so at first he didnt think the interaction was unusual. \"He asked me to pop my hood so he could look at the engine and I popped the hood and I got out and he was like, 'Oh, what kind of key do you have for it?' And my car was a keyless entry, where you push the start and I had the key in my pocket so I showed him. He snagged the key from my hand and pointed the gun to my chest and said, 'Back the f--- up, or I'll f------ kill you,'\" Parsons said.

         "description" : "This will involve numerous community events and a schools education programme. One of the areas high on the agenda is making sure that back lanes throughout the city are clear of bulky waste and rubbish bags that could be used to create illegal bonfires. People are being urged to dispose of their items in residential refuse bins or at one of the three approved recycling centres at Byker, Brunswick and Walbottle. For further details please visit www.newcastle.gov.uk/environment-and-waste Councillor Nick Kemp, Chair of Safe Newcastle, said: As the dark nights draw in and we get close to bonfire night, we really must look to make sure that we keep an eye on the fly tipping and general rubbish being left in back lanes. We know from experience that the rubbish dumped is often used for unofficial bonfires which can lead to all kinds of problems, from safety of the people involved but also damage to property and of worry to elderly residents. Our enforcement officers will be out monitoring the streets and back lanes to look to prevent bulky items being dumped and left and to prevent people collecting rubbish for unofficial fires. The City holds a number of official organised bon fires and we encourage people to attend these events. We would like to stress that the Council will prosecute those individuals or businesses who break the law and choose to ignore warnings and littering and fly tipping. All year round the Council operates the Keep it Clean campaign that is aimed at encouraging behavioural change amongst people who litter, fly-tip and dont pick up after their pets in Newcastle. It is hoped this campaign will help to stamp out a problem that has a knock-on effect across the city. Also, Your Homes Newcastle, the arms-length management organisation responsible for managing the citys council housing will be organising 34 clean-up events over a two week starting from Tuesday 20th October. This will give residents the chance to clear out any rubbish from their gardens before Bonfire Night. During the events, skips will be delivered to estates across the city and Your Homes Newcastle staff will be out-and-about helping people to make use of the temporary resources. Quite often rubbish left in residents gardens can be set alight or used on illegal bonfires so people are being encouraged to take this opportunity to have a clean-up and help keep their estates safe and tidy. A list containing all of the dates and times of the community clean-up events are available at www.yhn.org.uk/events.aspx . The Darker Nights programme looks to point people in the direction of official firework displays and bonfire events that are being organised by licensed and fully trained operators.

Crews responded to automatic fire alarms in Tewkesbury and Lydney, a minor car accident in Dursley, a flooding in Gloucester and were asked by the service to assist in the rescue of a paraglider in Haresfield Beacon at 1.45pm. Two crews helped move the injured paraglider to a waiting air ambulance ready to be taken to hospital. Deputy Chief Fire Officer Geoff Sallis said: \"Our contingency plans worked really well in the county and crews acted quickly and professionally on the occasions they were called upon.

If we can give people skills they dont currently have, and provide them with employment, we can reduce homelessness one coffee at a time, Cemal Ezel, founder of the non-profit organization behind the project, Change Please, told Mashable. The coffee trucks, which launched Monday, are selling $4 cups of exotic specialty brews from countries including Guatemala, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. The job pays nearly $14 an hour, which is the average minimum wage in London. Those working outside of London will receive almost $13 an hour, according to The Guardian. The organization is also offering to underwrite housing for their employees so they have a better chance of securing a rental property. Though only 12 workers are employed as of Monday, there are plans to expand the number to 100 employees by 2016. The carts will be central to the city for now, but The Guardian reports that the non-profit hopes to expand its operation into other UK cities including Bristol, Manchester, and Nottingham in England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland. The Change Please project was created in partnership with London coffee brewery Old Spike Roastery and U.K.-based magazine The Big Issue , which is known for employing homeless and long-term unemployed people to sell magazine copies on the streets. Homelessness is a growing issue in London, with Crisis , a national charity, reporting that the number of those sleeping on the streets rose 16 percent from the past year. Every year, tens of thousands are said to request homelessness assistance from local authorities, but a majority of single applicants dont qualify for housing. Last year, an estimated 280,000 people applied for homelessness assistance in England, where an estimated 53.9 million people live.

Various agencies work hard to prevent unnecessary deaths but Public Health England are hoping to save even more lives through a new partnership with fire and rescue services. Greater Manchester is one of three services chosen to support the health and social care system by promoting public health and preventative health care when visiting people in their homes. The service already visits over 60,000 homes each year to fit smoke alarms and provide fire safety advice but now firefighters will also use the opportunity to give advice on falls prevention, cold homes, social isolation and flu inoculations. They will take action or refer residents onto other health and social care services, including those provided by voluntary sector organisations such as Age UK. These checks will be known as Safe and Well visits, and will also see firefighters taking action and giving advice on health and crime prevention issues, as well as traditional fire safety measures. Chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, Councillor David Acton, said: Over the last 10 years we have seen accidental fires fall dramatically as a result of the early intervention our staff have carried out by providing fire safety advice and fitting smoke alarms. If we have the opportunity to make a bigger impact while we visit homes, by looking for obvious ways to keep people safe during winter or safe from crime, then why wouldnt we? We know we have unique access to a large number of homes, many are the same people who are at high risk of winter-related illnesses, so it makes sense to collaborate with PHE to improve the lives of residents in Greater Manchester. We want to use our skills and expertise to help save lives in other ways by working even more collaboratively with our health and social care partners. A spokesman from PHE said: Public Health England is working with the Local Government Association, NHS England, Age UK and the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) to develop a shared view of how fire and rescue services can use their capacity to support the health and social care system including promoting public health and preventative health care. Fire and rescue services have seen success in reducing demand for their services by taking a preventative approach through home safety visits (or more recently, safe and well visits). Those factors that predispose someone to being at risk from fire also predispose someone to be at risk of having or developing long term and other conditions that create demand for other organisations.

In all the team have helped to secure the conviction of 80 arsonists since the partnership between GMFRS and GMP began five years ago. Deputy Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner Jim Battle said: By working together, police, fire, communities, and local councils across Greater Manchester have done much in recent years to help make bonfire night a safer, enjoyable time for everyone. The work of the fire investigation team is a prime example of this. To those who still want to try and spoil the party, the message remains clear its not acceptable to put yourself and others at risk with dangerous bonfires or out-of-control fireworks. Of course people want to have fun and enjoy themselves and quite right too. But not at the cost of their own safety or others. Please be safe. Dont let a thoughtless moment of autumn fun escalate into anti-social behaviour or much worse a life-changing tragedy.

Id like to praise our staff for their hard work and professionalism last night and in the run-up to Bonfire Night in dealing with what remains the busiest time of the year for us. Weve had a busy night but were pleased that we received the lowest number of calls and incidents for 12 years. Were also delighted that most people had an enjoyable Bonfire Night and Id thank parents, children and the public in general for their support throughout the bonfire period.

The top-ranked Serb put on an impressive display against Kei Nishikori at the ATP finals on Sunday, stretching his winning streak to 15 matches at the season-ending tournament with a 6-1, 6-1 win at the O2 Arena. \"I think I was at my best,\" said Djokovic, who has won the last three titles at the ATP finals and four overall. \"Undoubtedly it's been an incredible performance that I was hoping I can have coming into the match, coming into this tournament.\" Djokovic lost only nine points on his serve and never faced a break point. With Nishikori serving, Djokovic won 30 of the 53 points played. Before the match, the ATP held a minute's silence for the victims of the Paris attacks. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Friday's attacks on the Stade de France, a concert hall and Paris cafes that left 129 people dead and more than 350 wounded, 99 of them seriously. In the late match, Roger Federer beat Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-2. View gallery Fans wave a banner for Japan's Kei Nishikori during his ATP World Tour Finals tennis match again Federer, a six-time champion who is playing at the season-ending tournament for the 14th straight year, got off to slow start, winning only one of the first nine points to fall behind 2-0. But he quickly turned things around and ended up with a pair of breaks in each set and another win in London. Federer will face Djokovic on Tuesday, while Berdych plays Nishikori. Djokovic has not lost at the season-ending tournament at the O2 Arena since 2011, when Janko Tipsarevic beat him in the round robin stage. Besides his run at the ATP finals, Djokovic has won 38 straight matches indoors, a streak stretching back to 2012. Nishikori, making his second appearance at the tournament for the top eight players in the world, found out just how good Djokovic is right now. \"I think my serve was the key. Both sets I lost my first service game,\" said Nishikori, who beat Djokovic in the 2014 U.S. For the original version including any supplementary images or video, visit http://news.yahoo.com/atp-holds-minutes-silence-victims-paris-attacks-141935441.html Various agencies work hard to prevent unnecessary deaths but Public Health England are hoping to save even more lives through a new partnership with fire and rescue services. Greater Manchester is one of three services chosen to support the health and social care system by promoting public health and preventative health care when visiting people in their homes. The service already visits over 60,000 homes each year to fit smoke alarms and provide fire safety advice but now firefighters will also use the opportunity to give advice on falls prevention, cold homes, social isolation and flu inoculations. They will take action or refer residents onto other health and social care services, including those provided by voluntary sector organisations such as Age UK. These checks will be known as Safe and Well visits, and will also see firefighters taking action and giving advice on health and crime prevention issues, as well as traditional fire safety measures. Chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, Councillor David Acton, said: Over the last 10 years we have seen accidental fires fall dramatically as a result of the early intervention our staff have carried out by providing fire safety advice and fitting smoke alarms. If we have the opportunity to make a bigger impact while we visit homes, by looking for obvious ways to keep people safe during winter or safe from crime, then why wouldnt we? We know we have unique access to a large number of homes, many are the same people who are at high risk of winter-related illnesses, so it makes sense to collaborate with PHE to improve the lives of residents in Greater Manchester. We want to use our skills and expertise to help save lives in other ways by working even more collaboratively with our health and social care partners. A spokesman from PHE said: Public Health England is working with the Local Government Association, NHS England, Age UK and the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) to develop a shared view of how fire and rescue services can use their capacity to support the health and social care system including promoting public health and preventative health care. Fire and rescue services have seen success in reducing demand for their services by taking a preventative approach through home safety visits (or more recently, safe and well visits).

         "description" : "Cleveland Fire Brigade launches campaign to tackle arson in the summer holidays Enough is Enough! Cleveland Fire Brigade launches campaign to tackle arson in the summer holidays Friday 17 July 2015 Jill Barber There will be no let-up in our efforts to tackle arson in our communities thats the message from Cleveland Fire Brigade as it launches its summer campaign to stop deliberate fires. Arson accounts for around 70% of fires across Cleveland and the Brigades Enough is Enough campaign aims to educate young people and the wider public about the dangers and consequences of starting fires. Last year, deliberate fires in the Cleveland area increased by 18 per cent during the eight week period covering the school summer holidays compared to the previous eight weeks. This totalled 456 fires from 11 July to 7 September compared to 388 from 16 May to 11 July. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection with Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: Arson ruins lives, communities and local businesses and our message is quite simple: Enough is Enough. We are watching you and anyone who starts a deliberate fire is likely to be caught. Our ongoing campaign involves targeting hot-spot areas and well be working closely with the Police and other organisations over the summer. North Shore Academy in Stockton-on-Tees hosted the launch which brought together firefighters, young people, community leaders and other key agencies. Pupils were able to view fire appliances, including a hydraulic platform and test their agility on the Brigades climbing wall. Firefighters were also on hand to give out fire safety advice. Mr Lancaster added: Were grateful to North Shore Academy for hosting our launch and allowing us to deliver our messages right into the heart of Stocktons community.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation this month directing state health officials to conduct educational and outreach programs about the \"physical, sexual and psychological\" effects of the procedure, which is practiced in various cultures around the world. The procedure carries the likelihood of life-long physical and psychological damage. While the practice is illegal, official estimates indicate that more than 7,500 girls and young women in New York are at risk of having the procedure, either within the state or overseas. By The Associated Press For the original version including any supplementary images or video, visit http://www.uticaod.com/article/20151127/NEWS/151129510/1994/NEWS?rssfeed=true The scheme works in a similar way to the Trusts volunteer Community First Responder scheme, where trained members of the public are despatched to life-threatening emergency calls within their local community. The added advantage to despatching fire crews, is their ability to respond on blue lights therefore arriving more quickly to a situation where literally every second can mean the difference between life and death. Fire crews will be paged by NWAS when a suspected cardiac arrest is reported within three miles of the fire station and despatched at the same time as an ambulance. Once the ambulance crew arrives, advanced life support will commence and the patient will be handed into the care of NWAS. North West Ambulance Service, Director of Operations, Derek Cartwright comments: This is an extremely positive project and its great to work with GMFRS on a scheme that will contribute to saving lives here in the Greater Manchester. The chances of survival from cardiac arrest diminish rapidly with every passing second so the sooner someone can receive treatment, the greater their chances are of leading a full and healthy life afterwards. It doesnt matter who gives that treatment whether it is a member of the public, an ambulance crew or a fire crew so the more resources there are available to respond, the better for those who suffer this potentially devastating condition. Last year, the ambulance service responded to 5,486 incidents in Greater Manchester where the patient had suffered a cardiac arrest sadly, despite everyones best efforts, not everyone survives but everyone deserves that chance and this is what this scheme will give people. Id like to thank Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service for their commitment to this project and I am sure there will soon be many patients who will also be alive to thank them.

         "description" : "Up to 50 firefighters and officers from 10 different fire stations, including from neighbouring South Yorkshire and Derbyshire fire and rescue services, were involved in the incident at its height. They used seven water jets, an aerial ladder platform and two light portable pumps to bring the fire under control. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) contacted the Environment Agency in the early hours of Sunday morning and Environment Officers attended the site. The Environment Agency continues to work with NFRS and is monitoring the situation closely. Worksop Station Manager Dick Dawson said: Our fire crews were faced with a severe fire in a building used for storing recycling material on the site and worked hard to bring it under control. This kind of fire is never straight forward as the fire is deep-seated in the product, and firefighters are currently working alongside staff from the recycling centre to dig out and break down the burning material in order to extinguish it in small pieces. This is a complicated and time-consuming process and it is likely that fire crews will be there some time to ensure the fire is out completely. However, I would like to reassure the people of Worksop that we are doing all we can to extinguish it as quickly as possible and get things back to normal at the centre and in the surrounding area. The cause of the fire is not yet known and an investigation is under way. Further updates will be available via Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Services Twitter and Facebook feeds, as well as through the local media.

Troy Deeney went from hero to villain at the game's close, cancelling out Memphis Depay's opener with an 87th-minute penalty, only to score a decisive own goal in added time. The Red Devils temporarily boast a one-point cushion over Manchester City and Arsenal after sealing their third consecutive victory with the win at Vicarage Road. Captain Wayne Rooney and young gun Anthony Martial were among the absentees for Louis van Gaal's side, but a string of deputies did enough to clinch a maximum-points haul on their trip to Hertfordshire. It was hardly a vintage performance from United, and although the team will care about their three points first and foremost, Match of the Dave questioned the Premier League's quality following such a tight result: If this United side is top of the table what does it say about the Premier League? Match of the Dave (@MatchoftheDave) November 21, 2015 Manchester United went into Saturday's fixture having not conceded a goal in their previous five outings, and the early signs suggested the travelling outfit might be capable of a sought-after sixth clean sheet in Hertfordshire. Van Gaal's side looked somewhat frantic as Quique Sanchez Flores' men endeavoured to get their own hold on the ball, but it took Depay just 11 minutes to put the visitors ahead. Ander Herrera lofted an inch-perfect chip over the Hornets defence, and the Dutchman waltzed through the middle to side-foot his volley beyond Watford No. 1 Heurelho Gomes. The strike was particularly well-timed considering theTelegraph's Paul Hayward confirmed Van Gaal's frustrations with the player just prior to kick-off, evidenceDepay was taking his opportunity with glee: Van Gaal \"expected more\" from Memphis Depay and Holland say he needs to be a \"team player.\" Temperament flaw ignored when 25m spent? Paul Hayward (@_PaulHayward) November 21, 2015 The opener helped steady United's ship for the remainder of the opening 45 minutes, during which a long-range Etienne Capoueeffort was the closest the home side came to breaking their deadlock.

You can watch the video here. Loud bangs and other unexpected noises, like fireworks, can have an adverse effect on those who have served in the armed forces, especially those suffering from PTSD. Wigan Council launched the campaign after a Facebook post published by Greater Manchester Armed Forces page reached over 100,000 people. The post asked people to be considerate towards veterans this Bonfire Night and received a lot of feedback. One of those veterans was ex-solider Andy Reid, who commented: I think it's very important people are made aware of the distress fireworks can cause veterans and serving personal. While serving in the Yorkshire Regiment in Afghanistan in 2009, Andy stood on an IED. Andy, who lives in St Helens, lost three limbs as a result of the explosion. Last week a firework was set off next to him. He said: After the firework went off I was very shaken and distressed as it was very close to me. I don't suffer from PTSD but if I had of done it would have been very traumatic and could of given me flashbacks. The campaign is supported by Treacle a Greater Manchester campaign aimed at preventing, anti-social behaviour, criminal damage and injuries during the Bonfire Night and Halloween Period. Chair of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, David Acton, said: We would like to wish everyone in Greater Manchester a safe and happy Bonfire Night.

Deputy Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner Jim Battle said: By working together, police, fire, communities, and local councils across Greater Manchester have done much in recent years to help make bonfire night a safer, enjoyable time for everyone. The work of the fire investigation team is a prime example of this. To those who still want to try and spoil the party, the message remains clear its not acceptable to put yourself and others at risk with dangerous bonfires or out-of-control fireworks. Of course people want to have fun and enjoy themselves and quite right too. But not at the cost of their own safety or others. Please be safe. Dont let a thoughtless moment of autumn fun escalate into anti-social behaviour or much worse a life-changing tragedy. Assistant County Fire Officer and Director of Prevention and Protection, Geoff Harris, said: The period around Halloween and Bonfire Night always sees an increase in arson.

Last year there were 214 deliberate fires across Cleveland over the bonfire period 15 October to 12 November costing the local community nearly half a million pounds. Redcar & Cleveland saw a 20 per cent increase in deliberate fires costing 126,000. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection at Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: We are urging residents to ensure they only put their bins out on the morning of collection and to bring them in as soon as possible to protect themselves and their property. Fires involving rubbish and bins can easily spread to your home, putting you at risk. To protect yourself, your family and your community, please follow our simple advice not just this bonfire season but all year round. Chief Superintendent Glenn Gudgeon from Cleveland Police, said: We have had several cases recently of bins being set on fire and then extended to premises, potentially putting lives at risk. A life sentence can be imposed on the offence of arrest with intent to endanger life and we dont want any young people sitting in prison for many years contemplating what was a stupid act of fun when they were young. Parents must also take responsibility for what their children are doing, where they are and who they are with. Equipping them with the knowledge around the dangers of starting fires will help to keep the whole community safe over the coming weeks. Councillor Helen McLuckie, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods at Redcar & Cleveland Council, added: In the lead up to bonfire night it is important that residents pay extra attention to how they store their wheelie bins and unwanted items, to help keep people safe and prevent anti-social behaviour. The most important step that anyone can take is to simply store bins away, ideally behind locked gates, especially at night and to make sure that rubbish does not pile up close to buildings.

Andy Cook said: Cleveland Fire Brigade has been working in partnership with Operation Florian to help develop the Fire and Ambulance Service in Harare, through the donation of surplus equipment, uniform, personal protective equipment and allowing our firefighters to carry out training in Harare. This project provides excellent development of our own staff and the equipment that is no longer required in Cleveland is helping to save lives in communities worldwide such as Zimbabwe. Everyone is looking forward to the trip and if we can play our part to assist vulnerable communities around the world then that can only be a good thing. Operation Florian is a UK Fire and Rescue Charity that works to assist Fire and Rescue services worldwide through the donation of equipment, appliances and training. Over the past twenty years the charity has worked in Europe, Africa, South America and Asia. The Cleveland team will be joined by a number of firefighters from other UK brigades including Lancashire, South Yorkshire, Royal Berkshire and Kent. The training provided to the Harare fire-fighters will include Incident Command, road traffic collisions, use of breathing apparatus, emergency care, hazardous materials and fire safety. Ian Hayton, Chief Fire Officer with Cleveland Fire Brigade, added: I am delighted that once again we have been able to join forces with other fire and rescue services in the UK to offer support to our counterparts in Zimbabwe. Clearly, the level of advancement of UK fire and rescue services means that we can help by putting our old equipment to good use and by passing on our knowledge and expertise theres no doubt that this will help to save lives and prevent injuries.

         "description" : "Fire Protection Officers at NFRS have seen a rise in the amount of prohibition notices being issued due to unsafe practices in restaurants and fast food outlets in Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) and emerging communities. This is partly due to language being a barrier to understanding safe business practice. Through research the Fire Protection Officers have identified hotspots within the county, and the aim of these lunches will be to educate business owners to create safe environments which embrace the culture of fire safety awareness. The lunches will be hosted by restaurant owner Iftikhar Ahmed at his restaurant Desi Grill Pri Pri Chicken on Monday 8 June and Tuesday 9 June, at 11:30am- 1:30pm for both days. Iftikhar Ahmed, owner of Desi Grill Pri Pri Chicken said: The concept of the business lunches is an excellent initiative for the community. I now have a greater understanding of the regulations I have to follow in order to keep my business successful. I know that other business owners within the Pakistani community often feel intimidated by business legislation and regulatory bodies, and are not aware of the support and advice they can actually receive. Working with NFRS has opened my eyes to see this and the support I have received has been very beneficial. I am looking forward to hosting the business networking lunches at my restaurant, and I feel it will be the start of building the bridge between the local community and business regulators. I can now act as an advocate for my community and set the example for other business owners in the area to follow. If you are a business owner I would urge you to come along as it will be a great chance to engage with regulators in a relaxed environment. Paul Cooper, organiser of the event and the Business Education Advocate for NFRS said: In order for us to engage with businesses in our community we have worked very closely with members of the Pakistani community to build a sense of trust and understanding. We want business owners to feel comfortable in coming along to the business lunches so they can learn the requirements regarding business premises from a Fire Protection perspective and have an understanding of any regulatory growth issues. The lunches are a great opportunity for business owners to receive valuable information from Environmental Health and business advice from the D2N2 Growth Hub.

Matt Lewis of the DailyMirrorreported Rooney was back in training for the Red Devils on Tuesday, but LvG said the game might have come too soon for the England captain as he regains fitness with Marouane Fellaini and Anthony Martial: That is not automatic [Rooney's selection]. It is always a decision of the manager. I compare, I compare always players with each other and I take into account how fit they are and how fit they show in the training sessions and thats why Marouane Fellaini, Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney have to show it on the training ground. Then I have to compare players with who are the best players to fit in with our game-plan. That is the same procedure with every match. OLI SCARFF/Getty Images Rooney missed the 2-1 win at Watford, which saw United climb to second in the Premier League, after suffering from an illness, as confirmed by Sky Sports . However, it appears the manager is unwilling to risk his star forward, if possible, but United's lack of options in the attack should see Rooney feature. Van Gaal also confirmed he has given Shaw time off ahead of the PSV game at Old Trafford anda scan on Friday. Shaw was seriously injured when the club visited Eindhoven in the Champions League, and the manager said the loss of the defender was a blow to his plans, per Lewis: I think the first match was very disappointing, not only because of the result but because if the loss of Luke Shaw.

But a smoke alarm can only save your life if it is working and the battery is checked regularly.\" More than 50 per cent of fires attended by county firefighters start in the kitchen, so people are asked to take particular care when cooking. Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"We want to reassure local people that the county fire and rescue service is fully prepared with plans in place to ensure communities get the protection they need.\" \"I must emphasise that people should still call 999 in an emergency so that an experienced control room operator can deal with their situation.

Test them regularly and keep them clean. Make an escape plan Plan an escape route and make sure everyone knows how to escape. Make sure exits are kept clear.

Cagneys owner, Lyn Kirkwood, said: It was horrendous. My husbands carer came round and she usually barks, but she was quiet. I looked in all the rooms and couldnt find her anywhere, then all of a sudden I heard a whimper and we found her stuck in the chair. We called the fire service and the RSPCA and we had three firefighter with tools trying to get her out. When they freed her she just walked off as if nothing had happened. Watch Manager Dave Minto led the effort to rescue Cagney. He said: Cagney had been stuck in that position for an hour. The dog was quite distressed when we arrived, but when she saw the crew Cagney quietened down and just sat there in total silence. We isolated the electric supply to the chair and took the mechanism apart - freeing Cagney after about half an hour. RSPCA Animal Welfare Officer, David Hatton, added: The dog had managed to get herself well and truly wedged in the chair. She was stuck head first in the mechanism, with just her back legs sticking out. The fire service were brilliant. They were able to dismantle the metal frame until she could free herself. It was a careful process, but luckily we were able to get her out uninjured. She seemed pretty unfazed by the whole thing, she just wandered off for a drink and came and sat by her owner.

Calls to the fraternity's attorney were not immediately returned. Deng, 19, died of brain damage and other injuries inflicted in December 2013 during a pledging ritual known as the glass ceiling at a rented home in the Pocono Mountain region of Pennsylvania. In addition to Li, Charles Lai, 24; Kenny Kwan, 26; Raymond Lam, 22; and Sheldon Wong, 23, all from Queens, face third-degree murder charges in Deng's death. Blindfolded and wearing a 30-pound back pack, Deng was tackled repeatedly and slammed to the ground, prosecutors said. The back pack was supposed to represent the weight of Pi Delta Psi, which describes itself as an Asian-American cultural fraternity. The glass ceiling gauntlet is intended to symbolize the difficulties Asian-Americans experience in battling prejudice. Li, who witnessed the final moments of Deng's hazing, said the victim staggered to his feet after being tackled by Lai. Shortly afterward, Kwan crashed into him with a 15-20 foot running start. His back hit the ground.

However, the thorough contingency plans put in place meant that 28 fire engines were ready to respond to emergencies. A total of 140 firefighters were available across the county - the same number as on an average Friday night. Despite a number of local people putting on bonfire night events and fireworks parties in the run-up to 5th November, fire crews weren't called to any firework related incidents during the strike period. Deputy Chief Fire Officer Geoff Sallis said: \"As with any strike period we ensured that significant contingency plans were in place, but on this occasion they weren't needed. I'm pleased that so many people in the county did their bit to remain safe.\" \"I'm also pleased that the fire crews on duty maintained the professional service that Gloucestershire deserves.\" Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"Once again the county service has demonstrated a great degree of professionalism, thanks to those fire crews that remained on duty.\" \"I hope that local people who are putting on fireworks parties over the weekend continue to do so safely and responsibly.\" The FBU has called on its members to engage in a second strike on Monday 4th November from 6am to 8am, for which GFRS again has thorough contingency plans in place.

Essex County Fire and Rescue Service is currently crowdfunding to raise money for two Firebreak courses. Each Firebreak course is a week-long intensive programme which has personal safety and wellbeing at its core. The courses, which are held at fire stations, enable disadvantaged young people in the community the opportunity to gain vital life skills. To help raise awareness of the Services award-winning scheme, a Twelve Days of Christmas advent calendar is being launched on ECFRS Twitter and Facebook; @ECFRS and facebook.com/ECFRS Beginning on 01 December, the calendar will include photos of the young people who have taken part in a Firebreak course. Young people who are referred to a Firebreak course often experience many challenges in their daily lives. This can include those struggling with self esteem, confidence, bereavement, life limiting illnesses, disability, as well as and those not in education, employment or training.

Firefighters test new thermal imaging cameras in training exercise in Basildon Firefighters at Essex County Fire and Rescue Service have tested the latest high-tech thermal imaging cameras during a high rise training exercise in Basildon. Crews from Basildon, Orsett, Billericay, Rayleigh, Wickford, Grays and Chelmsford Fire Stations took part in Exercise Ketling in multi-storey building in Southernhay, Basildon on November 20. The exercise gave firefighters the opportunity to test the latest ISG thermal imaging cameras, which will be used by frontline crews across the County. The cameras allow firefighters to search for people trapped in smoke filled rooms and find hot-spots which could be hidden behind a wall or in a roof space. These cameras are life savers, they are vital in helping find casualties when visibility is restricted because of smoke and darkness. Sub Officer Dan Evison from Basildon Fire Station organised the exercise, he said: Exercise Kelting was an excellent and rare opportunity for firefighters to train for a fire in a high rise building. Because of the location of the fire, crews had a physically demanding task to get the firefighting equipment up several floors before they then had to search the heavily smoke logged rooms to rescue casualties.

Jamarlon Qdashus Edwards has been charged with one count of first degree robbery and one count of first degree theft of property in one case.Alabaster police confirm those charges are from a carjacking that happened in the parking lot of the Game Stop in Probst Promenade on Nov. 9. The victim, Tyler Parsons, said a red Challenger pulled up next to him and the passenger got out to speak to him about cars, but ended up stealing the car at gunpoint. Parsons said several people have swapped sports car stories with him since he got the car in May, so at first he didnt think the interaction was unusual. \"He asked me to pop my hood so he could look at the engine and I popped the hood and I got out and he was like, 'Oh, what kind of key do you have for it?' And my car was a keyless entry, where you push the start and I had the key in my pocket so I showed him. He snagged the key from my hand and pointed the gun to my chest and said, 'Back the f--- up, or I'll f------ kill you,'\" Parsons said. Parsons said his car has since been found, but police believed it was totaled. Edwards is also charged ina previous robbery of an elderly victim in Alabaster, but police didn't release any other details about that incident. He is charged with one count of second degree robbery and one count of second degree assault in that case, police said on Monday. Edwards total bond is $2 million for all of the charges in Alabaster. He is currently in custody in Birmingham on capital murder charges in the death of Justin Poole, 27 . Bimringham police say Edwards shot Poole multiple times while Poolewas inside his white Buick on Nov. 7.

Tumble dryer warning Essex County Fire and Rescue Service has issued a safety warning after a number of tumble dryer brands are reviewing the safety of their products. The Service has warned residents not to leave appliances unattended following the recent safety checks on Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda tumble dryers. The review found that excess fluff was coming into contact with the heating element and creating a fire risk. Station Officer Andre Turner said: With the cold weather comes the increased need to dry clothes using a tumble dryer. The tumble dryers under review can still be used but they should never be left unattended. Essex County Fire and Rescue Service urges everyone to check their household appliances regularly and follow the manufacturers instructions. The Service has issued the following tumble dryer safety advice: Always follow the manufacturers instructions Dont use tumble dryers at night or while unattended Clean the filters regularly to ensure they do not become blocked with fluff Items should be removed from the dryer immediately after the cycle and shaken loose to assist cooling Not to overload plug sockets. Ensure that no more than 13 amps are in any one plug socket.

No reply. Paddy Power (@paddypower) November 25, 2015 Zoet was forced into making a first good save to deny Schneiderlin, while his colleague David De Gea also had to be sharp when Luukde Jong found some space to unleash a tricky shot. Moreno then placed a header well wide of the target after a great delivery from Andres Guardado, and Zoet showed his class with a superb reaction save on Martial. The PSV goalkeeper certainly made an impression during the first half, although he nearly committed a comical error under pressure from Rooney. He recovered just in time to prevent the veteran forward from scoring, and the score remained 0-0 going into half-time. Agence France-Presse's Tom Williams weighed in on the action: 0-0 at half-time. Best bit was when Jeroen Zoet accidentally kicked the floor and almost committed one of the all-time great goalie howlers. Tom Williams (@tomwfootball) November 25, 2015 The Red Devils came very close to breaking the deadlock early in the second half, but Lingard's header flew just past the post following a superb cross from Martial. Schneiderlin put Zoet back to work with a hard shot as United's pressure continued, but PSV looked dangerous on the counter attack. A poor pass from Smalling resulted in De Jong finding himself in a promising position, but he rushed his shot and fired over De Gea's goal. United manager Louis van Gaal made a double substitution in an effort to shake things up, with Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young entering for Bastian Schweinsteiger and Memphis. Samuel Luckhurst of the Manchester Evening News wasn't too happy with Memphis' efforts: Disappointing night for Memphis. Lacked variety and Young's chance there is overdue.

The initiative builds on the recent launch of a partnership between GMFRS and NWAS, which sees firefighters responding to cardiac arrests. Last year, NWAS responded to 5,486 incidents in Greater Manchester where the patient had suffered a cardiac arrest. This highlights the need to increase skills and confidence across the region, to give every person the best chance of survival. A survey of adults in the North West by the BHF revealed that just 44% know CPR. Just 36% of adults in the North West would be confident of performing immediate CPR if someone collapsed in front of them 61% of people would be worried about knowing what to do if someone collapsed with a cardiac arrest in front of them 64% of those who were worried said they feared making things worse by trying to help 45% of those who were worried admitted they would feel helpless Only 20% of people were able to correctly identify the signs2 that someone has had a cardiac arrest Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation, said: Survival rates for cardiac arrest are critically low in the North West and far too many lives are lost needlessly because not enough people have the skills and confidence to carry out lifesaving CPR. Sadly, you are most likely to witness a cardiac arrest at home, which is why its so important that more people are trained and are able to act in that situation. Performing CPR in those vital immediate minutes after a cardiac arrest can, in some cases, double a persons chance of survival. This unique partnership between three lifesaving organisations will give everyone across Manchester easy access to learn how to help save a life and create a Nation of Lifesavers. Following todays events, the CPR kits provided to GMFRS by the BHF will also be used on fire stations to train other community groups. NWAS Community Engagement Manager, Andrew Redgrave said: Earlier this year we launched our Cardiac Smart campaign to have the installation of AEDs in public places a legal requirement, in the same way that fire extinguishers are. Those who suffer a cardiac arrest will receive treatment when the ambulance crew arrives but if a member of the public can start that process while help is on the way, it can make a huge difference to their chances of survival.

At the end of the day though, nothing gets the points flowing more than goals, assists and clean sheets. So without further ado, let's get cracking... GOALKEEPERS Simon Mignolet- Liverpool have managed just one clean sheet in league play since Jurgen Klopp took over, but they have been averaging just one goal conceded, so they are teetering on respectability. I love a keeper at home and Swansea are a mess right now. Though they scored twice last week, it was against the Cherries who have shipped more goals than anyone, and both featured Jonjo Shelvey, who will be absent here. Heurelho Gomes- Admittedly, I have been disrespectful to Gomes' accomplishments this season thus far. I cannot ignore it any longer, he either gets clean sheets or racks up the saves. You have to think last place Villa will help him have another productive day. Jack Butland - Stoke's defense is as good as it gets in the league right now, as Butland has kept five clean sheets in the last six.

The majority of people who fell into this category in the last financial year - an estimated 36,300 were aged 75 and over compared to 7,700 people who were aged under 75. Chief Fire Officer Peter Dartford said that the statistics reinforced the need for a strong and committed collaboration between partners in order to protect the most vulnerable members of the community. He added: \"The statistics released by the Government today are worryingly high, particularly the revelation that 27 per cent more people die during the winter months compared with other times of the year. Many of these deaths could be avoided if there is greater understanding and increased partnership working between public sector organisations. \"In Staffordshire, we firmly believe that by joining forces with our partners in the NHS and social care we can have a major impact on the shocking upward trend we have witnessed with the release of these figures today. Our ethos is that we should identify and act upon possible issues before they come to fruition, avoiding a potential crisis for the individual involved. \"Earlier this month we, along with two other fire and rescue services, launched a truly ground-breaking pilot project with Public Health England which will benefit tens of thousands of the countrys most vulnerable residents. We have pledged to work together to tackle health and social problems and reduce winter pressures by making vital changes to the way we work. Our firefighters and community safety officers are now carrying out extended Safe and Well checks which means that our home safety visits are much more in-depth, focusing specifically on vulnerable residents and those with complex needs. \"With approximately 670,000 home safety checks carried out across the country every year, this is an incredible opportunity for us to reach those who are most in need of support.

         "description" : "Cameron: UK must attack IS in Syria to deny group safe haven - Yahoo News . LONDON (AP) British Prime Minister David Cameron urged skeptical lawmakers to back airstrikes on the Islamic State group in Syria, saying Thursday that the Paris attacks have given the fight new urgency and Britain owes it to key allies to act. Cameron told the House of Commons that President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande had urged Britain to join the military campaign in Syria. \"These are our closest allies and they want our help,\" he said. \"We have to hit these terrorists in their heartlands. We have not and we must not shirk our responsibility for security or hand it to others.\" Some previously skeptical lawmakers said they were convinced, but Cameron has not yet announced a date for a House of Commons vote on airstrikes. The Royal Air Force is part of a U.S.-led coalition attacking IS militants in Iraq, but not in Syria. Cameron has been reluctant to seek backing for strikes in Syria since lawmakers voted down his 2013 plan to launch RAF strikes against the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad. View gallery Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron leaves 10 Downing Street to attend Parliament in London, Many Britons are wary of getting drawn in to another Middle Eastern conflict after messy, bloody wars in Iraq and Libya. Earlier this month, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee said British airstrikes would be \"incoherent\" and ineffective without a plan to end Syria's four-year civil war. Cameron replied Thursday with a 36-page letter, arguing that Britain should act to deny the Islamic State group a \"safe haven\" from which to plot mass-casualty attacks like the Nov. 13 rampage that left 130 dead and hundreds wounded in Paris. He said airstrikes should be part of a \"comprehensive overall strategy\" to destroy IS, end the Syrian war and help rebuild the country. Attempting to allay legislators' concerns, Cameron answered questions for more than two hours in the House of Commons.

You will also find a huge selection of modern, stylish fire doors which are all available at great, online prices Up to 50 firefighters and officers from 10 different fire stations, including from neighbouring South Yorkshire and Derbyshire fire and rescue services, were involved in the incident at its height. They used seven water jets, an aerial ladder platform and two light portable pumps to bring the fire under control. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) contacted the Environment Agency in the early hours of Sunday morning and Environment Officers attended the site. The Environment Agency continues to work with NFRS and is monitoring the situation closely. Worksop Station Manager Dick Dawson said: Our fire crews were faced with a severe fire in a building used for storing recycling material on the site and worked hard to bring it under control. This kind of fire is never straight forward as the fire is deep-seated in the product, and firefighters are currently working alongside staff from the recycling centre to dig out and break down the burning material in order to extinguish it in small pieces. This is a complicated and time-consuming process and it is likely that fire crews will be there some time to ensure the fire is out completely. However, I would like to reassure the people of Worksop that we are doing all we can to extinguish it as quickly as possible and get things back to normal at the centre and in the surrounding area. The cause of the fire is not yet known and an investigation is under way. Further updates will be available via Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Services Twitter and Facebook feeds, as well as through the local media.

         "description" : "AROUND 3,500 young people were trained to be lifesavers today by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS). As part of European Restart a Heart Day, firefighters, staff and volunteers attended dozens of schools and colleges to teach CPR as part of a partnership with the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and North West Ambulance Service (NWAS). Its the first time the Service has been involved in the campaign and it proved really successful. The aim is to help create a nation of lifesavers and improve survival rates for out of hospital cardiac arrests there are around 30,000 every year in the UK and less than one in ten survive. Throughout Friday, October 16, fire crews, volunteers and support staff, visited around 35 schools delivering training with the help of CPR kits and mannequins provided by the BHF. Youngsters learned how to perform chest compressions and give rescue breaths to help keep the hearts blood pumping. At the same time, schools and colleges across the whole of the UK and Europe were taking part in their own training sessions as part of Restart a Heart Day a European campaign to teach people lifesaving skills so they can help someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest. Fiza, aged 13, is a pupil at William Hulme Grammar School in Whalley Range, Manchester. She said: This is the first time Ive done anything like this and I found it really interesting and Im sure it will be very useful. I want to be a doctor, so I think this learning was a good start for me. I can also now tell my friends and family how to do breaths of life and compressions. It was good to have the fire service here as they have experience of doing CPR in emergencies.

Year 10 pupil Jordan, from Oasis Academy in Oldham, said: I think the CPR training Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service is doing at schools is a great idea and really useful. It might even mean that we can save our mates lives and I feel confident that I could help someone if I came across them collapsed on the floor. Group Manager John Fletcher, who helped kick-start the day by supporting the training of around 150 students at Byrchall High School, said: People are often scared of doing CPR because theyre worried about causing more damage but in this situation you cant do anything to make things worse the worst thing you can do is nothing. Now that the all our fire stations have CPR kits and mannequins we can extend the training to other members of the community and create even more lifesavers. GMFRS County Fire Officer, Peter OReilly, said: Thanks to everyone who has taken part to help make this day such a huge success. Heart disease can affect people of any age and at any time so as an emergency service at the heart of the communities we serve we see it as our responsibility to help make everyone aware of heart health and how they can help in a medical emergency. Our firefighters are trained and experienced in CPR and the use of lifesaving equipment such as defibrillators so we want to pass on our skills to as many people as possible to ensure they have the best possible chance at helping to save a life.

Cleveland Fire Brigade launches campaign to tackle arson in the summer holidays Friday 17 July 2015 Jill Barber There will be no let-up in our efforts to tackle arson in our communities thats the message from Cleveland Fire Brigade as it launches its summer campaign to stop deliberate fires. Arson accounts for around 70% of fires across Cleveland and the Brigades Enough is Enough campaign aims to educate young people and the wider public about the dangers and consequences of starting fires. Last year, deliberate fires in the Cleveland area increased by 18 per cent during the eight week period covering the school summer holidays compared to the previous eight weeks. This totalled 456 fires from 11 July to 7 September compared to 388 from 16 May to 11 July. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection with Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: Arson ruins lives, communities and local businesses and our message is quite simple: Enough is Enough. We are watching you and anyone who starts a deliberate fire is likely to be caught. Our ongoing campaign involves targeting hot-spot areas and well be working closely with the Police and other organisations over the summer. North Shore Academy in Stockton-on-Tees hosted the launch which brought together firefighters, young people, community leaders and other key agencies. Pupils were able to view fire appliances, including a hydraulic platform and test their agility on the Brigades climbing wall.

         "description" : "The thorough contingency plans put in place meant that 24 fire engines were ready to respond to emergencies and a total of 138 firefighters were available across the county. Crews responded to automatic fire alarms in Tewkesbury and Lydney, a minor car accident in Dursley, a flooding in Gloucester and were asked by the service to assist in the rescue of a paraglider in Haresfield Beacon at 1.45pm. Two crews helped move the injured paraglider to a waiting air ambulance ready to be taken to hospital. Deputy Chief Fire Officer Geoff Sallis said: \"Our contingency plans worked really well in the county and crews acted quickly and professionally on the occasions they were called upon. As with any strike period, we ask local people to do their bit to remain safe in their homes and businesses and I'm pleased so many have taken our advice on board.\" Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"Once again the county service has demonstrated a great degree of professionalism, thanks largely to those fire crews that remained on duty.\" ENDS Notes to Editors: Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service offers free Home Fire Safety Checks and fits smoke alarms free of charge for elderly and vulnerable people in the community.

Louis van Gaal, perhaps keen to avoid heading to Germany requiring a victory, named an attacking United line-up featuring former PSV star Memphis Depay , Wayne Rooney , Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial in a four-man attack. The quartet'sfluidity caused plenty of problems for PSV early on, although the home side failed to break the deadlock in the firsthalf as Martial missed two good opportunities. United's frustration only mounted in the early part of the second period as they struggled against the Eredivisie outfit's resolute backline. And the visitors' resilience paid dividends, with a point meaning PSV will progress if they overcome CSKA Moscow at home and Van Gaal's menfail to beat Wolfsburg. The game featured apoignant moment in the seventh minute as supporters displayed mobile-phone lights in a tribute to United legend George Best, who died 10 years ago to the day. PSV's cause was not helped by being forced into an 18th-minute change, Gaston Pereiro replacing the injured Luciano Narsingh . The hosts began to grow into the game thereafter, epitomised by Matteo Darmian delivery a fizzing cross that narrowly evaded Rooney. United almost forced a deserved opener in the 31st minute when Jeroen Zoet denied Morgan Schneiderlin 's sliding effort after the midfielder met Daley Blind 's corner. That seemed to awaken the visitors, who fashioned an opening of their own as Jorrit Hendrix forced a save from David de Gea . A glorious chance came United's way soon after as Lingard's blocked shot found its way to Martial, whose low effort was kept out by Zoet. The PSV goalkeeper denied Martial again on the stroke of half-time, saving a stinging strike low at his near post.

         "description" : "I heard Eleanor call for help, so I shouted to her to get out of the house and to shut the doors behind her to stop the fire spreading. I could just see Eleanor shut the kitchen door and so ran round to the front of the house where she was coming out. Thats when I rang for the fire service and they were there really quickly. I have a friend in the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service and I remembered him telling him me how lethal smoke is in a fire and that you should get out of the house straightaway. Im glad my advice worked and that Eleanor came out OK. The fire started after Mrs Smith moved her old microwave across her kitchen worktop and on to the hob of her electric oven to make space for a replacement microwave. The mini cooker accidentally caught the on dial on the electric oven, which slowly heated the microwave until both ovens caught fire, setting off the smoke alarm on the ground floor. Mrs Smith said: I didnt want my kitchen to get any further damaged so I tried to put the fire out myself. My first thought was to put the flames out and it didnt seem such a difficult thing to do. But the fire was so much bigger than I initially thought. I didnt realise the smoke would be that bad. Im so grateful to Michael for stopping and helping me. He was so good to stop and come to my aid. Firefighters from Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service (TWFRS) wearing breathing apparatus went in to the kitchen and carried the microwave outside before pouring water over the appliance to ensure the fire was fully out. Nicole Mordecai, Watch Manager in Community Safety for Sunderland, said: Our advice if you have a fire is very simple get out of the house immediately, stay out and dial 999.

LINDSEY PARNABY/Getty Images However, they simply didnt perform to the requisite level. The first-team players Wenger called upon largely played as if they were scared of following Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott to the treatment room. Losing those two players is undoubtedly a blow for Arsenal, especially because theyre both capable of filling in on the right wing. Wengers preferred choice in that position,Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey, is already out. To suffer three muscular injuries in the same part of the field is definitely unfortunate, and it leaves Wenger facing a difficult decision over how to restructure his attack on Saturday at the Liberty Stadium. Matthew Lewis/Getty Images He certainly wont be in a hurry to call-up any of the youngsters he trialled in the Sheffield Wednesday game. There were high hopes for the likes of Alex Iwobi, who has already been capped by the Nigeria senior team, but no one delivered a performance that suggested they were ready for first-team inclusion. The reality is that the most promising young talents at Arsenalthe likes of Gedion Zelalem, Isaac Hayden and Chuba Akpomare out on loan. In fact, Akpom and Hayden both featured for their temporary club Hull City last night as they progressed to the next round by beating Leicester City. Overall, Arsenal gave the impression of a team who couldnt wait to be out of this competition. The sense prevails that the club feel they have bigger fish to fry. With Chelsea floundering, the Gunners appear to be the only real competition for the Manchester clubs in the fight for Premier League superiority. That wont be much consolation to the Arsenal fans who travelled to Sheffield to watch such a poor performance.

Maria Boon, head of prevention at Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said: \"We are delighted that so many schools and community groups across the county have taken up the opportunity to learn our vital safety lessons.\" \"Young peoples safety is at the heart of what we do and SkillZONE is the perfect environment in which to teach it. We will continue to reach out to groups that might benefit from touring the centre - it could be a lifesaver.\" Adam Hanwell, 11, toured the facility with Crudwell Cub Scouts. His dad Tom Hanwell said the visit was particularly eye-opening because they had recently had a fire at home. Tom said: \"We came home to 6ft flames coming out of the chimney and all the emergency services were there. It was completely alien to my son and he couldn't understand it.\" At the end of the SkillZONE tour he had a much better idea of what firefighters and emergency services do. It taught him exactly what to do if he was ever in a similar situation. Our scouts valued the trip so much we will definitely come again. The centre has also been used for a wide range of community events including Older Peoples Month, Black History Month, Child Accident Prevention Week and for safety courses for young mums. Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: \"In the past year, we've had countless classes and community groups come through the doors of SkillZONE and nothing but positive feedback.\" \"Many who have visited are already looking to return and I hope the centre will continue to go from strength to strength.\" Anyone who would like to know more or book a two hour tour should visit http://skillzone.glosfire.gov.uk/ or put a date in their diary to attend a SkillZONE open day on Saturday July 19th.

Firefighters test new thermal imaging cameras in training exercise in Basildon Firefighters at Essex County Fire and Rescue Service have tested the latest high-tech thermal imaging cameras during a high rise training exercise in Basildon. Crews from Basildon, Orsett, Billericay, Rayleigh, Wickford, Grays and Chelmsford Fire Stations took part in Exercise Ketling in multi-storey building in Southernhay, Basildon on November 20. The exercise gave firefighters the opportunity to test the latest ISG thermal imaging cameras, which will be used by frontline crews across the County. The cameras allow firefighters to search for people trapped in smoke filled rooms and find hot-spots which could be hidden behind a wall or in a roof space. These cameras are life savers, they are vital in helping find casualties when visibility is restricted because of smoke and darkness. Sub Officer Dan Evison from Basildon Fire Station organised the exercise, he said: Exercise Kelting was an excellent and rare opportunity for firefighters to train for a fire in a high rise building.

Science News Recording the responses of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to different visual patterns, using methods adapted from the study of vision in humans, scientists in York's Department of Biology investigated the nervous systems of flies with different types of Parkinson's mutations. Funded by the Wellcome Trust, researchers compared flies carrying mutations associated with early-onset Parkinson's with 'normal' control flies, and found increased neuronal activity to stimulation in the former group in 'young' flies. By mapping the visual responses of fruit flies with different Parkinson's genes, the scientists built a substantial data bank of results. Using this they were able to classify unknown flies as having a Parkinson's related mutation with 85 per cent accuracy. Researchers believe it may be possible to transfer this method back to the clinic where early changes in vision may provide a 'biomarker' allowing screening for Parkinson's before the onset of traditional motor-symptoms. Therefore, profiling human visual responses could prove an accurate and reliable test in diagnosing people with early-onset PD. This method is also likely to succeed when transferred to human detection of Parkinson's, as visual profiling in humans has proved accurate in the past in detecting genetic markers. In this study, as more complex light stimulations have been used, a more accurate picture of detecting a wider variety of different genetic markers has been revealed. Dr Ryan West, Postdoctoral Research Scientist in York's Department of Biology and Lead Author on the study, said: \"Increased visual activity in young fruit flies with early-onset Parkinson's mutations is a significant finding, as it may provide an early-onset biomarker for people at risk of Parkinson's. \"Using 64 different combinations of visual stimuli, we now have a comprehensive bank of the reactions of fruit flies carrying different genetic mutations. We can see that fruit flies carrying different mutations have distinct patterns of visual responses, suggesting this is a reliable method in classifying Parkinson's genotypes. \"We hope this method may be translatable to the clinic where changes in vision may provide an early indication of early-onset Parkinson's.

The Brigade, along with Cleveland Police and Redcar & Cleveland Council is encouraging all residents to keep their bins secure and out of sight to avoid them becoming a target for arsonists. Last year there were 214 deliberate fires across Cleveland over the bonfire period 15 October to 12 November costing the local community nearly half a million pounds. Redcar & Cleveland saw a 20 per cent increase in deliberate fires costing 126,000. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection at Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: We are urging residents to ensure they only put their bins out on the morning of collection and to bring them in as soon as possible to protect themselves and their property. Fires involving rubbish and bins can easily spread to your home, putting you at risk. To protect yourself, your family and your community, please follow our simple advice not just this bonfire season but all year round. Chief Superintendent Glenn Gudgeon from Cleveland Police, said: We have had several cases recently of bins being set on fire and then extended to premises, potentially putting lives at risk. A life sentence can be imposed on the offence of arrest with intent to endanger life and we dont want any young people sitting in prison for many years contemplating what was a stupid act of fun when they were young. Parents must also take responsibility for what their children are doing, where they are and who they are with. Equipping them with the knowledge around the dangers of starting fires will help to keep the whole community safe over the coming weeks. Councillor Helen McLuckie, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods at Redcar & Cleveland Council, added: In the lead up to bonfire night it is important that residents pay extra attention to how they store their wheelie bins and unwanted items, to help keep people safe and prevent anti-social behaviour.

         "description" : "We want everyone to enjoy Bonfire Night but we urge people to stay safe by following the firework code and by attending displays that are well organised.\" The Service is recommending that the public play it safe and attend organised events which are subject to stringent health and safety regulations. Community Safety Officers have once again been out and about visiting schools across the county with Operation Good Guy. The initiative educates pupils about the dangers of fireworks using hard-hitting messages and demonstrations. Leaflets featuring top tips are being distributed to shops across Staffordshire and eye-catching posters will be displayed in social clubs, community centres and other facilities. Director of Prevent and Protect, Glynn Luznyj said: We want everyone to enjoy Bonfire Night but we urge people to stay safe by following the firework code and by attending displays that are well organised. Children should always be supervised when handling sparklers as they are the cause of many injuries. A sparkler burns at a temperature over fifteen times the boiling point of water and three sparklers burning together can generate the same heat as a blowtorch. Officers have been delivering safety message to schools about the dangers of fooling with fireworks but it is important that parents re-enforce our vital message as it could have life-saving consequences. If you do choose to have a private celebration, remember the following bonfire safety tips: If you are having a bonfire, discuss it with your neighbours beforehand Dont build a bonfire too far in advance as it could encourage anti-social behaviour Build the bonfire away from sheds, trees and wooden fences Check there are no cables including telephone wires above the bonfire Ensure there is a suitable barrier around the bonfire to keep spectators at least five metres away Always check that no children or animals are hiding in the bonfire before lighting it Dont burn aerosols, batteries, tyres, canisters or anything containing foam or paint as it may produce toxic fumes and some canisters may explode, causing injury Dont use petrol, paraffin, diesel, white spirit or methylated spirit to light the bonfire Keep some buckets of cold water close by in case of an emergency as well as to damp down after the event People using sparklers are being urged to remember the following safety tips: Light one sparkler at a time Supervise children with sparklers and never give them to anyone under five-years-old Ensure that everyone handling sparklers is wearing gloves Hold lit sparklers at arms length Dont wave sparklers about when close to other people Never hold a baby in your arms when holding a sparkler When you have finished with the sparkler put it in a bucket of cold water People are being encouraged to follow the Firework Code which can be found at http://www.staffordshirefire.gov.uk/1324.asp In an emergency dial 999.

Cleveland Fire Brigade launches campaign to tackle arson in the summer holidays Friday 17 July 2015 Jill Barber There will be no let-up in our efforts to tackle arson in our communities thats the message from Cleveland Fire Brigade as it launches its summer campaign to stop deliberate fires. Arson accounts for around 70% of fires across Cleveland and the Brigades Enough is Enough campaign aims to educate young people and the wider public about the dangers and consequences of starting fires. Last year, deliberate fires in the Cleveland area increased by 18 per cent during the eight week period covering the school summer holidays compared to the previous eight weeks. This totalled 456 fires from 11 July to 7 September compared to 388 from 16 May to 11 July. Phil Lancaster, Director of Community Protection with Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: Arson ruins lives, communities and local businesses and our message is quite simple: Enough is Enough. We are watching you and anyone who starts a deliberate fire is likely to be caught. Our ongoing campaign involves targeting hot-spot areas and well be working closely with the Police and other organisations over the summer. North Shore Academy in Stockton-on-Tees hosted the launch which brought together firefighters, young people, community leaders and other key agencies. Pupils were able to view fire appliances, including a hydraulic platform and test their agility on the Brigades climbing wall. Fire doors are available in a number of ratings that indicate the length of time that the door can withstand fire and heat. The lowest rating is FD30, offering thirty minutes protection. FD30 doors, be they glass, semi-glazed, panel or flush are typically 45mm thick, compared to the standard door thickness of 35 mm.

Were pleased to see a reduction in overall incidents including deliberate bonfires and want to thank the public for helping keep bonfire night safe this year. As we move towards the weekend we want to remind people to be safe and the best way to do that is to attend an organised display. If people must buy fireworks for use at home we would urge them to only buy ones which comply with British Standard BS7114 and to please follow the Firework Code. This is not only for their safety but for that of their family and friends as well. The Brigade is also issuing a reminder that only adults should set off fireworks and parents should make their children aware of the dangers of playing with them. The Firework Code Keep fireworks in a closed box Follow the instructions on each firework Light all fireworks at arms length Stand well back Never go back to a lit firework Never put fireworks in your pocket Never throw fireworks Do not drink alcohol if setting off fireworks. If anyone has any information about arson or anti-social behaviour in their area, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or the Police on 101.

         "description" : "This will involve numerous community events and a schools education programme. One of the areas high on the agenda is making sure that back lanes throughout the city are clear of bulky waste and rubbish bags that could be used to create illegal bonfires. People are being urged to dispose of their items in residential refuse bins or at one of the three approved recycling centres at Byker, Brunswick and Walbottle. For further details please visit www.newcastle.gov.uk/environment-and-waste Councillor Nick Kemp, Chair of Safe Newcastle, said: As the dark nights draw in and we get close to bonfire night, we really must look to make sure that we keep an eye on the fly tipping and general rubbish being left in back lanes. We know from experience that the rubbish dumped is often used for unofficial bonfires which can lead to all kinds of problems, from safety of the people involved but also damage to property and of worry to elderly residents. Our enforcement officers will be out monitoring the streets and back lanes to look to prevent bulky items being dumped and left and to prevent people collecting rubbish for unofficial fires. The City holds a number of official organised bon fires and we encourage people to attend these events. We would like to stress that the Council will prosecute those individuals or businesses who break the law and choose to ignore warnings and littering and fly tipping. All year round the Council operates the Keep it Clean campaign that is aimed at encouraging behavioural change amongst people who litter, fly-tip and dont pick up after their pets in Newcastle. It is hoped this campaign will help to stamp out a problem that has a knock-on effect across the city. Also, Your Homes Newcastle, the arms-length management organisation responsible for managing the citys council housing will be organising 34 clean-up events over a two week starting from Tuesday 20th October. This will give residents the chance to clear out any rubbish from their gardens before Bonfire Night. During the events, skips will be delivered to estates across the city and Your Homes Newcastle staff will be out-and-about helping people to make use of the temporary resources. Quite often rubbish left in residents gardens can be set alight or used on illegal bonfires so people are being encouraged to take this opportunity to have a clean-up and help keep their estates safe and tidy. A list containing all of the dates and times of the community clean-up events are available at www.yhn.org.uk/events.aspx . The Darker Nights programme looks to point people in the direction of official firework displays and bonfire events that are being organised by licensed and fully trained operators.

Key themes from the plans will be explained and debated on NFRS Facebook page and via its Twitter profile @nottsfire to allow people easy access to the information in the coming weeks. The Service is legally obliged to produce plans to say how it will help people prevent fires, collisions and others incidents at homes and businesses in the county and, if the worst does happen, how firefighters will respond to incidents. People from around the county are entitled to a say in those plans and NFRS is aiming to make it as easy as possible through visiting key locations and talking to people face-to-face as well as showing how firefighters and staff will serve the county on Facebook and Twitter. Station Manager Simon Glew said: We know that people have busy lives and thats why were making it as easy as possible for them to have a say in the future of their fire and rescue service. We will be giving people a snapshot of how the plans come to life in the work that they see our firefighters and staff doing every day as well as letting them know what is happening at our consultation events and what the opinions of other people are. Wed ask people to get involved and give us their views its your fire service, your say. Each week, one of the Services priorities from the plans will be discussed and began on Monday 25 September with Priority 1 Service Delivery, which includes prevention work in the community, training firefighters for incidents and ensuring NFRS is able to respond to incidents.

         "user" : "prophe",
         "description" : "Vietnam\u2019s first non-state university, Thang Long University, was founded in 1988 by a group of intellectuals. It had to wait for five years to be recognised as a successful pilot of a non-state higher education model. \r\n\r\nAfter this a series of legal frameworks were enacted to regulate three different types of non-state universities: those \u2018people-founded\u2019 institutions established by social and professional associations; private universities set up by corporates or individuals; and those which are semi-public \u2013 set up by the state but wholly financed by private income. \r\n\r\nHowever, because of the sensitivities in a communist country, no private university was allowed. The remaining two types of non-state university enjoyed more than a decade of stability and prosperity. \r\n\r\nAn uneasy introduction\r\n\r\nThe government officially legalised private universities in 2005. A few months later, the new version of the Education Law, passed by the National Assembly, recognised only two types of non-state universities, namely people-founded and private. The semi-public model was phased out. \r\n\r\nA year later, the prime minister allowed the first 19 people-founded universities to transfer to private status, with the remaining expected to follow suit. However, that transfer is still incomplete despite detailed guidance from the Ministry of Education and Training issued in 2014. \r\n\r\nOne reason for the delay is the significant differences in ownership between people-founded and private universities. The management board of people-founded universities consists not only of investors but also the university\u2019s founders, the rector, faculty representatives etc. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, investors are the sole owners of private universities, holding the highest decision-making authority. Hence, it was difficult to reach an internal consensus on the transfer of a people-founded university to private status. \r\n\r\nFor many of those that did reach a consensus, private university status brought more uncertainty than opportunities. Hung Vuong University started and completed its transfer in 2010. However, an internal dispute quickly arose and affected the Ministry of Education and Training. Both the chairman of the management board, a known businessman, and the rector were dismissed after revelations of wrongdoing by inspectors and student recruitment was suspended. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, after firing hundreds of staff and faculty the dying university had only a handful of staff and around 50 students left, but a huge debt of more than US$2 million. This was difficult to believe for a university founded by a noted doctor and professor, led by committed faculty and with over 10,000 students in its heyday before the transfer. \r\n\r\nHung Vuong shared the same fate as many first-generation people-founded universities. In the early 1990s, the private economy emerging from the Doi Moi (Innovation) policy in 1986 was still immature. Capitalists and investors with stable financial resources were almost non-existent. \r\n\r\nHence, initial investment in non-state universities came from hundreds of people, some of whom contributed non-monetary assets. In such cases, determining the value of non-monetary assets so contributors could be compensated, as was required during the transfer process, proved complicated. Once that obstacle had been overcome, another one lay in waiting. \r\n\r\nIn the mid-2000s, entrepreneurs and corporates who had prospered from the country\u2019s amazing economic growth started targeting private universities as super-profitable investments. With abundant financial resources, they quickly secured management positions in those universities and turned them into money-making machines. \r\n\r\nInside these universities were two opposing factions: committed faculty who prioritised education quality and investors whose ultimate goal was maximising profit. \r\n\r\nPrivate-public competition\r\n\r\nThis sort of turbulence was not the only thing private universities had to face. They have also been thrown into direct and fierce competition with public universities that are usually the first choice for high school graduates. \r\n\r\nIt is not the low, subsidised tuition fees that attract these students, but the quality of education offered and the chance to get a recognised graduate degree. However, public universities, constrained by state funding, must deal with the enrolment quota set by the ministry. This unintentionally means that private universities are able to recruit those students who fail to get into public universities.\r\n\r\nThe situation has changed significantly since 2014 when several top public universities were approved to pilot a financial autonomy scheme. This means they will no longer have to rely on state funding and are free to set their own student recruitment quotas. \r\n\r\nCurrently, 13 public universities, several of which are national elite universities, have piloted this scheme and Deputy Minister of Education and Training Professor Bui Van Ga has said the number of public universities applying for the scheme will not be capped. This policy puts private institutions in direct battle with public ones, a fight which private institutions are much less likely to win.\r\n\r\nNot-for-profit private higher education\r\n\r\n\u2018Not-for-profit\u2019 status emerged for the first time in the Higher Education Law of 2012. Two years later, not-for-profits were more clearly defined in the University Charter as universities where \u201Cshareholders receive dividends in proportion to their shareholding, although the dividend must be lower than state bond rates\u201D. \r\n\r\nThe legal emergence of \u2018not-for-profits\u2019 in 2012 brought problems that were equally severe as those which surfaced in the case of private status transfer. Internal conflicts arose immediately inside many private institutions that had been for profit. The not-for-profit model, often coupled with the kind of liberal education synonymous with the Ivy League, is appealing to educators. By contrast, investors in private universities saw the model as posing a serious threat to their investment.\r\n\r\nThese fierce internal conflicts turned Hoa Sen University, a high-performing private university that was highly valued by employers, upside down. The rector claimed that the university had been not-for-profit in its original design in the early 1990s. However, a group of shareholders held an extraordinary meeting and voted against her and the board chairman, who was also an intellectual inspired by the not-for-profit model. \r\n\r\nFor the two years following the introduction of the new policy, news of internal conflicts at the university hit the headlines and sparked heated debates among educators, policy-makers and society at large. The battle finally ended just before the close of 2016 when the government officially recognised the new management board which immediately dismissed the tenacious rector and re-directed the university back to the \u2018normal\u2019 path of private higher education, despite faculty and student protests.\r\n\r\nA gloomy outlook\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Vietnamese higher education system consisted of 428 institutions, 85 of which were private. Private universities enrolled almost 270,000 students, accounting for roughly 13% of total enrolment numbers. Compared with the target of 40% by 2020 set by the Higher Education Reform Agenda in 2005, the current percentage is too modest. Most doubt this goal can be achieved. \r\n\r\nPrivate higher education, whether for-profit or not, has proven to be a successful model in many countries. However, this does not seem to be the case in Vietnam, due to many factors, including political ones. \r\n\r\nThe battle between \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018for-profit' education and political sensitivities due to the country\u2019s communist background, combined with an inconsistent approach, have hampered the growth of private institutions. What is more, the number of students in private institutions has shown signs of stagnation. All of these factors collectively paint a gloomy picture for private higher education in Vietnam. ",

         "description" : "The initiative was devised by the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) and was launched with widespread support from MPs, Councillors and Chief Fire Officers. They have signed an open letter to government asking for a review of provisions for fire sprinklers in building standards as well as a more proactive approach to the use of sprinkler and fire suppression systems. The sprinkler issue is already a high priority for Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service and the Service has worked extensively with housing provider Nottingham City Homes to identify which of their properties are occupied by people who are most at risk of fire. As a result Nottingham City Homes is installing sprinklers into some of its high rise blocks and new build bungalows and flats. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service has also invested in a number of portable misting systems which will be allocated to some of the countys most vulnerable residents. Officers from the Services Fire Protection team are using Fire Sprinkler Week to raise awareness and promote the use of sprinklers in commercial premises. Chief Fire Officer Frank Swann said: For some time now nearly all fire and rescue services across the country have been promoting the use of sprinklers in both domestic and commercial properties. Many, like us, have been working alongside partners such as housing providers to ensure sprinklers are either retro-installed as necessary or are included in the plans for new-build properties. Although the issue has been on the national agenda for a while, it is important that initiatives like this are used to further promote awareness and understanding, as well as winning support from the government. We are therefore pleased to support Fire Sprinkler Week and will do all we can as a Service to continue to keep this issue at the forefront of peoples hearts and minds.

Alli has been one of Tottenham's most regularly selected players so far. In part this is due to injuries suffered by Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb, but Mauricio Pochettino has spent his managerial career handing opportunities to deserving young players. Alli is in that category. Initially, Pochettino sought to inflict his energetic movement and aggression on tired defenders, inflicting him on Spurs' opposition as a late substitute. Against Manchester United , Leicester City and Everton , Tottenham needed a goal, and they turned to their supposedly unproven 19-year-old. Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images Alli has since started eight matches in all competitions after reinforcing Pochettino's high opinion of him with a string of fine displays. Since winning a place in the starting lineup, Alli has been primarily deployed in a two-man midfield. This is a demanding role for the youngster as it requires him to contribute in both attacking and defensive phases of play. He has quickly developed a knack for energetically dispossessing opponents and quickly turning defence into attack. Eric Dier's rugged presence in Tottenham's midfield has been something of a security blanket for Alli. With Dier's burgeoning qualities as a strictly defensive presence, Alli is freed somewhat. When Dier was suspended against Liverpool , Alli's attacking output was curtailed as he was required to put in a defensive shift. Alli has also been used in the attacking line behind the main striker where his ability to go beyond the front man has helped create space for Spurs and confusion for their opposition. In both roles, Alli's constant involvement is his greatest contribution. Lacking the passing range to create space with the ball, it is his movement that makes him such a valuable teammate. Constantly seeking space and demanding the attention of multiple defenders, Alli is a nightmare to defend against. The primary beneficiary of that skill set has been Heung-Min Son. Son and Alli instantly developed a footballing relationship. Their similarities: Both are technical, aggressive, very quick and have the ability to create positional overloads and goalscoring opportunities. The evident chemistry promises to make them a devastating tandem once Son returns from injury. Alli's nominative position is in central midfield, but he shows remarkable flair for a player comfortable in deep positions. His nutmegs are already becoming a celebrated part of his game. While shrewd judges like Henry Winter predicted Alli's aptitude for Premier League football, few could have expected he would shine with such immediacy. Per the Telegraph, Henry Winter tagged the youngster as a \"future England international\" in February but could not have known that Alli would get his chance just eight months later. Alli's signing last January was met with the reserved enthusiasm it seemingly deserved. Young, English and flashy, the obvious comparisons seemed to be with Manchester United's acquisition of Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace on a similar deal in 2013. The step up ultimately proved too much for Zaha, and he has since returned to Palace. Alli shone brighter than Zaha in the lower divisions, but coming from League One, he had to make a greater leap. In hindsight, it is easy to suggest that Zaha lacked Alli's qualities, but both players won theFootball League Young Player of the Year award and were touted for honours. Zaha made his England debut as Alli has, but that is where any fair comparisons must end. Of course, the lastFootball League Young Player of the Year Spurs signed was Gareth Bale . At this point, Alli seems more likely to follow Bale's ascent to the very top than Zaha's less flattering trajectory. Already, Alli is a star. Having outshone seasoned international Mousa Dembele and ably replaced Christian Eriksen's creative drive, it is easy to get carried away with just how good he could be. He has scored just once in the 810 minutes he has played this season. That is a disappointing return for a player of his attacking quality. It is certain to be a ratio that will improve as the season goes on, but Alli was a 16-goal player last season and will be desperate to add that final product. The poise that he consistently shows in dangerous areas is guaranteed to facilitate plenty of goals in what the fans will hope is a long Spurs career. Once Tottenham's senior midfielders return from injury, Alli will likely be forced back onto the bench. At this point, his progress will be stilted, but the quality he has already shown in the first months of this campaign will ensure he continues to get his chances. With a packed fixture list, Alli is certain to enjoy a busyfirstseason in the top flight. There is little precedent for a player as young as Alli making so consistent an impression in the brutal dogfight that is a Premier League midfield. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard are two of very few such players. Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images Alli idolised Gerrard as a child and is doing a fair imitation of the West Ham-vintage Lampard. His potential is as remarkable as the fact that Spurs were able to sign him for so little. With the world's biggest clubs now alerted to his seemingly boundless potential, Tottenham may yet face a battle to retain him. Paul Doyle, with the Guardian , a publication as reliable as transfer rumours mongers go, has suggested that Ligue 1 leviathan Paris Saint-Germain are among his admirers. Pochettino to be loathe to lose a young player set for stardom so PSG would be compelled to pay an enormous fee to take him across the channel. Perhaps the Guardian was merely searching for an opportunity to unleash their punny rejoinder \"Alli les Bleus.\" For the original version including any supplementary images or video, visit http://feeds.bleacherreport.com/articles/2584500-analysing-dele-allis-early-season-form-for-tottenham Fire doors are fitted with an intumescent strip which is fitted around the sides and top of either the door or its frame.

I heard Eleanor call for help, so I shouted to her to get out of the house and to shut the doors behind her to stop the fire spreading. I could just see Eleanor shut the kitchen door and so ran round to the front of the house where she was coming out. Thats when I rang for the fire service and they were there really quickly. I have a friend in the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service and I remembered him telling him me how lethal smoke is in a fire and that you should get out of the house straightaway. Im glad my advice worked and that Eleanor came out OK. The fire started after Mrs Smith moved her old microwave across her kitchen worktop and on to the hob of her electric oven to make space for a replacement microwave. The mini cooker accidentally caught the on dial on the electric oven, which slowly heated the microwave until both ovens caught fire, setting off the smoke alarm on the ground floor. Mrs Smith said: I didnt want my kitchen to get any further damaged so I tried to put the fire out myself. My first thought was to put the flames out and it didnt seem such a difficult thing to do. But the fire was so much bigger than I initially thought. For the original version including any supplementary images or video, visit http://www.twfire.gov.uk/news/news/?entryid67=80361",

         "volume": "6","number": "5","pages": "435-440","abstract": "Natural ecosystems are one of our most precious resources, critical for sustaining life on the planet. The benefits humans derive from ecosystems are varied, from marketable products such as pharmaceuticals, to recreational opportunities such as camping, to ecosystems services such as erosion control and water purification. For many people, nature plays a powerful spiritual and aesthetic role in their lives, and many place a high value on the existence of wilderness and nature for its own sake. Despite the critical roles ecosystems play, these areas are increasingly threatened by the impacts of a growing human population through habitat destruction and air and water pollution. Added to these stresses comes a new threat â\u20AC\u201D global climate change resulting from increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. â\u20ACœEcosystems and Global Climate Changeâ\u20AC\u009D is the fifth in a series of the Pew Center reports examining the potential impacts of climate change on the U.S. environment. It details the very real possibility that warming over this century will jeopardize the integrity of many of the terrestrial ecosystems on which we depend. Among the many key issues raised are With warming, the distribution of terrestrial ecosystems will change as plants and animals follow the shifting climate. The eastern United States will likely lose many of its deciduous forests as the climate zones shift northwards, while more mountainous regions, like portions of the West, will see species and ecosystems migrate up mountain slopes from lower elevations.Both the amount and rate of warming predicted represent a threat to our nation\u2019s biodiversity. Certain species may face dwindling numbers and even extinction if they are unable to migrate fast enough to keep up with the changing climate. Likewise, as warming shrinks the zone of cold conditions in upper latitudes and on mountains, the future of species that depend on such climates will be in jeopardy.Climate change is likely to alter ecosystem composition and function â\u20AC\u201D that is, which species make up an ecosystem and the way in which energy and materials flow through these systems. These modifications are bound to alter the amount and quantity of the various goods and services ecosystems provide.Ecosystems are inherently complex and difficult to model, and our ability to predict exactly how species and ecosystems will respond to a changing climate is limited. This uncertainty limits our ability to mitigate, minimize, or ameliorate the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. In order to maximize nature\u2019s own potential to adapt to climate change, we must continue to support existing strategies to conserve biodiversity and protect natural ecosystems.

The possible changes in regional climate under this target level of global warming have so far not been investigated in detail. Using an ensemble of 15 regional climate simulations downscaling six transient global climate simulations, we identify the respective time periods corresponding to 2\u2009°C global warming, describe the range of projected changes for the European climate for this level of global warming, and investigate the uncertainty across the multi-model ensemble. Robust changes in mean and extreme temperature, precipitation, winds and surface energy budgets are found based on the ensemble of simulations. The results indicate that most of Europe will experience higher warming than the global average. They also reveal strong distributional patterns across Europe, which will be important in subsequent impact assessments and adaptation responses in different countries and regions. For instance, a North\u2013South (West\u2013East) warming gradient is found for summer (winter) along with a general increase in heavy precipitation and summer extreme temperatures. Tying the ensemble analysis to time periods with a prescribed global temperature change rather than fixed time periods allows for the identification of more robust regional patterns of temperature changes due to removal of some of the uncertainty related to the global models\u2019 climate sensitivity.",

         "volume": "559","number": "7714","pages": "387--391","abstract": "Evidence from palaeoclimatology suggests that abrupt Northern Hemisphere cold events are linked to weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)1, potentially by excess inputs of fresh water2. But these insights\u2014often derived from model runs under preindustrial conditions\u2014may not apply to the modern era with our rapid emissions of greenhouse gases. If they do, then a weakened AMOC, as in 1975\u20131998, should have led to Northern Hemisphere cooling. Here we show that, instead, the AMOC minimum was a period of rapid surface warming. More generally, in the presence of greenhouse-gas heating, the AMOC\u2019s dominant role changed from transporting surface heat northwards, warming Europe and North America, to storing heat in the deeper Atlantic, buffering surface warming for the planet as a whole. During an accelerating phase from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, the AMOC stored about half of excess heat globally, contributing to the global-warming slowdown. By contrast, since mooring observations began3\u20135 in 2004, the AMOC and oceanic heat uptake have weakened. Our results, based on several independent indices, show that AMOC changes since the 1940s are best explained by multidecadal variability6, rather than an anthropogenically forced trend. Leading indicators in the subpolar North Atlantic today suggest that the current AMOC decline is ending. We expect a prolonged AMOC minimum, probably lasting about two decades. If prior patterns hold, the resulting low levels of oceanic heat uptake will manifest as a period of rapid global surface warming.",

It's harmful effects have been discussed and documented in studies, statements and reports scientists of different backgrounds, geographical and disciplines. Yet statesmen whose primary duties they are to initiate and implement programmes to curb, at least, if not completely eliminate the harmful effects tend to be unconcerned, or at most playing lip service to the issue. Gas flaring in Nigeria with its harmful effects started in the 1950s when oil exploration began. Studies have shown that Nigeria is the world's worst gas farer. It is estimated that about 2.5 billion cubic feet about 70 percent of the 3.5 billion cubic feet gas produced annually in Nigeria are wasted by flaring. Successive Nigerian governments have not made concerted efforts to stop gas flaring. How has gas flaring in Nigeria contributed to global warming climate change What would Nigerian government do to completely stop gas flaring and thus its attendant harmful effects Addressing these questions is the major plunge of this paper.

Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, create an energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) even as the planet warms to adjust to this imbalance, which is estimated to be 0.5\u20131\u2009W\u2009m−2 over the 2000s. Annual global fluctuations in TOA energy of up to 0.2\u2009W\u2009m−2 occur from natural variations in clouds, aerosols, and changes in the Sun. At times of major volcanic eruptions the effects can be much larger. Yet global mean surface temperatures fluctuate much more than these can account for. An energy imbalance is manifested not just as surface atmospheric or ground warming but also as melting sea and land ice, and heating of the oceans. More than 90\\% of the heat goes into the oceans and, with melting land ice, causes sea level to rise. For the past decade, more than 30\\% of the heat has apparently penetrated below 700\u2009m depth that is traceable to changes in surface winds mainly over the Pacific in association with a switch to a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 1999. Surface warming was much more in evidence during the 1976\u20131998 positive phase of the PDO, suggesting that natural decadal variability modulates the rate of change of global surface temperatures while sea-level rise is more relentless. Global warming has not stopped; it is merely manifested in different ways.",

Any artifacts in the observed decadal and centennial variations associated with these issues could have important consequences for scientific understanding and climate policy. We use a completely different approach to investigate global land warming over the 20th century. We have ignored all air temperature observations and instead inferred them from observations of barometric pressure, sea surface temperature, and sea-ice concentration using a physically based data assimilation system called the 20th Century Reanalysis. This independent data set reproduces both annual variations and centennial trends in the temperature data sets, demonstrating the robustness of previous conclusions regarding global warming.",

The possible changes in regional climate under this target level of global warming have so far not been investigated in detail. Using an ensemble of 15 regional climate simulations downscaling six transient global climate simulations, we identify the respective time periods corresponding to 2\u2009°C global warming, describe the range of projected changes for the European climate for this level of global warming, and investigate the uncertainty across the multi-model ensemble. Robust changes in mean and extreme temperature, precipitation, winds and surface energy budgets are found based on the ensemble of simulations. The results indicate that most of Europe will experience higher warming than the global average. They also reveal strong distributional patterns across Europe, which will be important in subsequent impact assessments and adaptation responses in different countries and regions. For instance, a North\u2013South (West\u2013East) warming gradient is found for summer (winter) along with a general increase in heavy precipitation and summer extreme temperatures. Tying the ensemble analysis to time periods with a prescribed global temperature change rather than fixed time periods allows for the identification of more robust regional patterns of temperature changes due to removal of some of the uncertainty related to the global models' climate sensitivity.",

However, natural internal variability may exacerbate anthropogenic warming to produce temporary excursions above 1.5°C. Such excursions would not necessarily exceed the Paris Agreement, but would provide a warning that the threshold is being approached. Here we develop a new capability to predict the probability that global temperature will exceed 1.5°C above pre\u2010industrial levels in the coming five\u2010years. For the period 2017 to 2021 we predict a 38% and 10% chance respectively of monthly or yearly temperatures exceeding 1.5°C, with virtually no chance of the five\u2010year mean being above the threshold. Our forecasts will be updated annually to provide policy makers with advanced warning of the evolving probability and duration of future warming events.",

In this study, coupled climate model simulations are used to form large ensembles of simulated years at 1.5\u2009°C and 2\u2009°C of global warming. These ensembles are used to assess projected changes in the frequency and magnitude of European climate extremes at these warming levels. For example, we find that events similar to the European record hot summer of 2003, which caused tens of thousands of excess deaths, would be very likely at least 24% less frequent in a world at 1.5\u2009°C global warming compared to 2\u2009°C global warming. Under 2\u2009°C of global warming, we could expect such extreme summer temperatures in the historical record to become commonplace, occurring in at least one-in-every-two years. We find that there are very clear benefits to limiting global warming for the European continent, including fewer and less intense heat and rainfall extremes when compared with higher levels of global warming.",

While much political attention is focused on the potential for global warming of 2°C relative to pre-industrial, the AR4 projections clearly suggest that much greater levels of warming are possible by the end of the twenty-first century in the absence of mitigation. The centre of the range of AR4-projected global warming was approximately 4°C. The higher end of the projected warming was associated with the higher emissions scenarios and models, which included stronger carbon-cycle feedbacks. The highest emissions scenario considered in the AR4 (scenario A1FI) was not examined with complex general circulation models (GCMs) in the AR4, and similarly the uncertainties in climate\u2013carbon-cycle feedbacks were not included in the main set of GCMs. Consequently, the projections of warming for A1FI and/or with different strengths of carbon-cycle feedbacks are often not included in a wider discussion of the AR4 conclusions. While it is still too early to say whether any particular scenario is being tracked by current emissions, A1FI is considered to be as plausible as other non-mitigation scenarios and cannot be ruled out. (A1FI is a part of the A1 family of scenarios, with 'FI' standing for 'fossil intensive'. This is sometimes erroneously written as A1F1, with number 1 instead of letter I.) This paper presents simulations of climate change with an ensemble of GCMs driven by the A1FI scenario, and also assesses the implications of carbon-cycle feedbacks for the climate-change projections. Using these GCM projections along with simple climate-model projections, including uncertainties in carbon-cycle feedbacks, and also comparing against other model projections from the IPCC, our best estimate is that the A1FI emissions scenario would lead to a warming of 4°C relative to pre-industrial during the 2070s. If carbon-cycle feedbacks are stronger, which appears less likely but still credible, then 4°C warming could be reached by the early 2060s in projections that are consistent with the IPCC's 'likely range'.",

This discrepancy has become known as the global warming 'hiatus' and a variety of mechanisms1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 have been proposed to explain the observed slowdown in warming. Focusing on internally generated variability, we use pre-industrial control simulations from an observationally constrained ensemble of GCMs and a statistical approach to evaluate the expected frequency and characteristics of variability-driven hiatus periods and their likelihood of future continuation. Given an expected forced warming trend of \\~0.2 K per decade, our constrained ensemble of GCMs implies that the probability of a variability-driven 10-year hiatus is \\~10\\%, but less than 1\\% for a 20-year hiatus. Although the absolute probability of a 20-year hiatus is small, the probability that an existing 15-year hiatus will continue another five years is much higher (up to 25\\%). Therefore, given the recognized contribution of internal climate variability to the reduced rate of global warming during the past 15 years, we should not be surprised if the current hiatus continues until the end of the decade. Following the termination of a variability-driven hiatus, we also show that there is an increased likelihood of accelerated global warming associated with release of heat from the sub-surface ocean and a reversal of the phase of decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean.",

Yet, previous research has shown that some people believe they have personally experienced global warming. Through four related studies, our paper sheds light on what signals of global warming some people believe they are detecting, why, and whether or not it matters. These studies were conducted using population survey and climatic data from a single county in Michigan. Study 1 found that 27\\% of the county's adult residents felt that they had personally experienced global warming. Study 2 \u2013 based on content analysis of people's open-ended responses \u2013 found that the most frequently described personal experiences of global warming were changes in seasons (36\\%), weather (25\\%), lake levels (24\\%), animals and plants (20\\%), and snowfall (19\\%). Study 3 \u2013 based on NOAA climatic data \u2013 found that most, but not all, of these detected signals are borne out in the climatic record. Study 4 \u2013 using the survey data \u2013 found that personal experience of global warming matters in that it predicts perceptions of local risk of global warming, controlling for demographics, political affiliation, and cultural beliefs about national policy outcomes. We conclude that perceived personal experience of global warming appears to heighten people's perception of the risks, likely through some combination of direct experience, vicarious experience (e.g., news media stories), and social construction. â\u0096º Belief in experiencing global warming significantly predicted local risk perception. â\u0096º Changes to seasons, weather, lake levels, species, and snowfall were most reported. â\u0096º Respondents reported less snowfall due to global warming; recent data suggest otherwise.",

Among environmental risks of global scope climate change is probably the one receiving the most attention at present, not least in the media. Globalization notwithstanding, national media are still dominated by a national logic in the presentation of news, and tensions arise between this media logic and the transnational character of environmental risks that call for a collective responsibility transcending the borders of the nation-states. This article presents results from studies of the construction of global climate change in three Swedish newspapers. It discusses the media's attribution of responsibility for collective action along an axis ranging from local to national to transnational, and highlights the media's reluctance to display any kind of scientific uncertainty that would undermine the demand for collective action. The results underline the media's responsiveness to the political setting in which they operate and the growing relevance of the transnational political realm of Europe for the construction of news frames on global climate change in European national media.",

However local interpretation of impacts resulting from these targets are required if the public is to have a sound appreciation of their consequences. Some of the largest impacts are likely to arise from changes in extreme events, for example heatwaves and floods. This article estimates future regional heat extreme changes consistent with specific global warming targets, using a new and presently unique ensemble of physically plausible climate simulations. We find that a subset of ensemble members giving globally averaged temperature increases of 2.0 ± 0.5°C shows a wide range of changes in regional temperature extremes. For example, changes in extreme single-day hot events range between 2 and 6 °C for large parts of Europe, North America and Asia for this target. Plausible variations in the model representation of forest roughness length, vegetation root depth and boundary layer cloud make the largest individual contributions to the spread of changes found in different parts of the world. However, a wide range of processes contribute to the uncertainties in the regional changes, particularly through their direct or indirect influences on the simulation of soil moisture.",

In contrast, many heat wave definitions employed by meteorologists include a continuous threshold-exceedance duration criterion. This study examines the hazard of these diverse sequences of extreme heat in the present, and their change with global warming. We define compound heat waves to include those periods with additional hot days following short breaks in heat wave duration. We apply these definitions to analyze daily temperature data from observations, NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory global climate model simulations of the past and projected climate, and synthetically generated time series. We demonstrate that compound heatwaves will constitute a greater proportion of heat wave hazard as the climate warms, and suggest an explanation for this phenomenon. This result implies that in order to limit heat-related mortality and morbidity with global warming, there is a need to consider added vulnerability caused by the compounding of heat waves.",

         "abstract": "Climate change is expected to lead to changes in seasonal temperature-related mortality. However, this impact on health risk does not necessarily scale linearly with increasing temperature. By examining changes in risk relative to degrees of global warming, we show that there is a delayed emergence of the increase in the summer mean mortality risk in England and Wales. Due to the relatively mild summer mean temperatures under the current climate and the non-linearity of the exposure-response relationships, minimal changes in summer mean risk are expected at lower levels of warming and an escalation in risk is projected beyond 2.5°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial levels. In contrast, a 42% increase in mortality risk during summer heat extremes is already expected by 2°C global warming. Winter attributable mortalities, on the other hand, are projected to decrease largely linearly with global warming in England and Wales.",

This paper examines model projections of climate change over the twenty-first century from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report which used the A2 scenario from the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, assessing whether different regional responses can be seen in models categorized as 'high-end' (those projecting 4°C or more by the end of the twenty-first century relative to the preindustrial). It also identifies regions where the largest climate changes are projected under high-end warming. The mean spatial patterns of change, normalized against the global rate of warming, are generally similar in high-end and 'non-high-end' simulations. The exception is the higher latitudes, where land areas warm relatively faster in boreal summer in high-end models, but sea ice areas show varying differences in boreal winter. Many continental interiors warm approximately twice as fast as the global average, with this being particularly accentuated in boreal summer, and the winter-time Arctic Ocean temperatures rise more than three times faster than the global average. Large temperature increases and precipitation decreases are projected in some of the regions that currently experience water resource pressures, including Mediterranean fringe regions, indicating enhanced pressure on water resources in these areas.",

A simplified method for diagnosing tropical precipitation change is tested here on present-day El Niño\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) precipitation shifts. This method, based on the weak temperature gradient approximation, assumes precipitation is associated with local surface relative humidity (RH) and surface air temperature (SAT), relative to the tropical mean. Observed and simulated changes in RH and SAT are subsequently used to diagnose changes in precipitation. Present-day ENSO precipitation shifts are successfully diagnosed using observations (correlation r = 0.69) and an ensemble of atmosphere-only (0.51 ≤ r ≤ 0.8) and coupled (0.5 ≤ r ≤ 0.87) climate model simulations. RH (r = 0.56) is much more influential than SAT (r = 0.27) in determining ENSO precipitation shifts for observations and climate model simulations over both land and ocean. Using intermodel differences, a significant relationship is demonstrated between method performance over ocean for present-day ENSO and projected global warming (r = 0.68). As a caveat, the authors note that mechanisms leading to ENSO-related precipitation changes are not a direct analog for global warming\u2013related precipitation changes. The diagnosis method presented here demonstrates plausible mechanisms that relate changes in precipitation, RH, and SAT under different climate perturbations. Therefore, uncertainty in future tropical precipitation changes may be linked with uncertainty in future RH and SAT changes.",

In relative terms, decrease is highest in Scandinavia, in absolute terms in France. The electricity sector is not only a substantial source of carbon emissions, but also vulnerable to climate change, both due to the growing share of renewables and due to temperature related changes in seasonal demand patterns. In this study we provide information on the impacts of +2 °C global warming on heating and cooling electricity demand for 26 European countries, based on 11 EURO-CORDEX climate simulations, presenting mean changes but also weather-induced changes in peak demand. Smooth transition regression models are used to estimate the relationship between daily electricity consumption and population weighted temperature. Assuming present demographic and economic structures, global warming by 2 °C reduces electricity consumption in most European countries. The reduced heating electricity demand outweighs the increase in cooling demand. The highest decrease in relative terms is found for Norway (up to −5.2\\%), followed by Sweden, Estonia, Finland, and France. Italy is the only country for which an overall increase in electricity demand is projected. The decrease of electricity demand in absolute terms is projected to be by far the highest in France (between −10 TW h and −16 TW h p. a.). In most countries peak demand of electricity for cooling and heating increases, whereby climate scenario uncertainties in case of heating are high. Altogether, a cross-country comparison heavily suggests that climate is not the main driver for the amount of electricity used for heating and cooling purposes, but rather energy policy.",

Under a scenario of 1\\% increase per year of CO2 emission, the model ensemble projects globally more heavy precipitation (+7\u2009±\u20092.4\\%K−1), less moderate precipitation (−2.5\u2009±\u20090.6\\%K−1), more light precipitation (+1.8\u2009±\u20091.3\\%K−1), and increased length of dry (no-rain) periods (+4.7\u2009±\u20092.1\\%K−1). Regionally, a majority of the models project a consistent response with more heavy precipitation over climatologically wet regions of the deep tropics, especially the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Asian monsoon regions, and more dry periods over the land areas of the subtropics and the tropical marginal convective zones. Our results suggest that increased CO2 emissions induce a global adjustment in circulation and moisture availability manifested in basic changes in global precipitation characteristics, including increasing risks of severe floods and droughts in preferred geographic locations worldwide.",

The effects of climate change on living organisms have been shown primarily on regional and global scales. Here I propose the \u201CEvolution Canyon\u201D (EC) microscale model as a potential life monitor of global warming in Israel and the rest of the world. The EC model reveals evolution in action at a microscale involving biodiversity divergence, adaptation, and incipient sympatric speciation across life from viruses and bacteria through fungi, plants, and animals. The EC consists of two abutting slopes separated, on average, by 200 m. The tropical, xeric, savannoid, \u201CAfrican\u201D south-facing slope (AS = SFS) abuts the forested \u201CEuropean\u201D north-facing slope (ES = NFS). The AS receives 200\u2013800\\% higher solar radiation than the ES. The ES represents the south European forested maquis. The AS and ES exhibit drought and shade stress, respectively. Major adaptations on the AS are because of solar radiation, heat, and drought, whereas those on the ES relate to light stress and photosynthesis. Preliminary evidence suggests the extinction of some European species on the ES and AS. In Drosophila, a 10-fold higher migration was recorded in 2003 from the AS to ES. I advance some predictions that could be followed in diverse species in EC. The EC microclimatic model is optimal to track global warming at a microscale across life from viruses and bacteria to mammals in Israel, and in additional ECs across the planet.",

Recent climate scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are analysed here to explore the geographical origin of, and the possible reasons for, uncertainties in the hydrological model response to global warming. Using the twentieth century simulations and the SRES-A2 scenarios from eight different coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models, it is shown that the main uncertainties originate from the tropics, where even the sign of the zonal mean precipitation change remains uncertain over land. Given the large interannual fluctuations of tropical precipitation, it is then suggested that the El Niño Southern Ocillation (ENSO) variability can be used as a surrogate of climate change to better constrain the model reponse. While the simulated sensitivity of global land precipitation to global mean surface temperature indeed shows a remarkable similarity between the interannual and climate change timescales respectively, the model ability to capture the ENSO-precipitation relationship is not a major constraint on the global hydrological projections. Only the model that exhibits the highest precipitation sensitivity clearly appears as an outlier. Besides deficiencies in the simulation of the ENSO-tropical rainfall teleconnections, the study indicates that uncertainties in the twenty-first century evolution of these teleconnections represent an important contribution to the model spread, thus emphasizing the need for improving the simulation of the tropical Pacific variability to provide more reliable scenarios of the global hydrological cycle. It also suggests that validating the mean present-day climate is not sufficient to assess the reliability of climate projections, and that interannual variability is another suitable and possibly more useful candidate for constraining the model response. Finally, it is shown that uncertainties in precipitation change are, like precipitation itself, very unevenly distributed over the globe, the most vulnerable countries sometimes being those where the anticipated precipitation changes are the most uncertain.",

Using a four-decade specimen series of 70 716 individuals of 52 North American migratory bird species, we demonstrate that increasing annual summer temperature over the 40-year period predicts consistent reductions in body size across these diverse taxa. Concurrently, wing length \u2013 an index of body shape that impacts numerous aspects of avian ecology and behaviour \u2013 has consistently increased across species. Our findings suggest that warming-induced body size reduction is a general response to climate change, and reveal a similarly consistent and unexpected shift in body shape. We hypothesise that increasing wing length represents a compensatory adaptation to maintain migration as reductions in body size have increased the metabolic cost of flight. An improved understanding of warming-induced morphological changes is important for predicting biotic responses to global change.",

Between the 1950s and 1980s, declining surface solar radiation ( \u201D global dimming\u201D) likely caused a dampening of global warming, whereas increasing surface solar radiation ( \u201D brightening\u201D) may have contributed to the rapid warming in the last 2 decades, and possibly also in the first half of the twentieth century. This is also reflected in the decadal evolution of diurnal temperature range, which is highly correlated with surface solar radiation, and which shows a distinct transition from a strong decrease between the 1950s and 1980s, toward a leveling off thereafter. The present study investigates to what extent these effects are simulated in the latest generation of global climate models used in the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report (AR4) (phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) models). While these models reproduce the overall twentieth century warming over global land surfaces well, they underestimate the decadal variations in the warming and particularly also in diurnal temperature range, indicative of a lack of decadal variations in surface solar radiation in the models.",

This paper reviews physical and empirical arguments which suggest that global warming may result in a more intense hydrological cycle, with an associated increase in the frequency and/or magnitude of heavy precipitation. Results derived from enhanced-greenhouse experiments using global climate models (GCMs) are shown to be consistent with these physical and empirical arguments. Detailed analysis of output from three GCMs indicates the possibility of substantial increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme daily precipitation, with amplification of the effect as the return period increases. Moreover, return period analyses for locations in Australia, Europe, India, China and the USA indicate that the results are global in scope. Subsequent discussion of the limitations of GCMs for this sort of analysis highlights the need for caution when interpreting the precipitation results presented here. However, the consistency between physically-based expectations, empirical observations, and GCM results is considered sufficient for the GCM results to be taken seriously, at least in a qualitative sense, especially considering that the alternative seems to be reliance by planners on the fundamentally flawed concept of a stationary climate.",

         "volume": "2","abstract": "The production of solar energy in cities is clearly a way to diminish our dependency to fossil fuels, and is a good way to mitigate global warming by lowering the emission of greenhouse gases. However, what are the impacts of solar panels locally? To evaluate their influence on urban weather, it is necessary to parameterize their effects within the surface schemes that are coupled to atmospheric models. The present paper presents a way to implement solar panels in the Town Energy Balance scheme, taking account of the energy production (for thermal and photovoltaic panels), the impact on the building below and feedback toward the urban micro-climate through radiative and convective fluxes. A scenario of large but realistic deployment of solar panels on the Paris metropolitan area is then simulated. It is shown that solar panels, by shading the roofs, slightly increases the need for domestic heating (3\\%). In summer, however, the solar panels reduce the energy needed for air-conditioning (by 12\\%) and also the Urban Heat Island (UHI): 0.2 K by day and up to 0.3 K at night. These impacts are larger than those found in previous works, because of the use of thermal panels (that are more efficient than photovoltaic panels) and the geographical position of Paris, which is relatively far from the sea. This means that it is not influenced by sea breezes, and hence that its UHI is stronger than for a coastal city of the same size. But this also means that local adaptation strategies aiming to decrease the UHI will have more potent effects. In summary, the deployment of solar panels is good both globally, to produce renewable energy (and hence to limit the warming of the climate) and locally, to decrease the UHI, especially in summer, when it can constitute a health threat.",

The shift of the centers of action leads to a failure in capturing the NAO change with the traditional definition of the NAO index. A modified index is introduced that allows for this shift, and exhibits a tendency toward the positive phase and an enhancement of its intensity. The intensification of Icelandic low is tied up with zonal mean state change, and the strengthened Azores high is related to the stationary wave change. The shift of the centers of action of the NAO is associated with the stationary wave change.",

Such projections are mostly based on off-line aridity and drought metrics applied to climate model outputs but also are supported by climate-model projections of decreased surface soil moisture. Here we comprehensively analyze soil moisture projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, including surface, total, and layer-by-layer soil moisture. We identify a robust vertical gradient of projected mean soil moisture changes, with more negative changes near the surface. Some regions of the northern middle to high latitudes exhibit negative annual surface changes but positive total changes. We interpret this behavior in the context of seasonal changes in the surface water budget. This vertical pattern implies that the extensive drying predicted by off-line drought metrics, while consistent with the projected decline in surface soil moisture, will tend to overestimate (negatively) changes in total soil water availability.",

Significant progress has been made in elucidating the magnitude and physical origins of present-day unforced GMST variability, but it has remained unclear how such variability may change as the climate warms. Here we present modelling evidence that indicates that the magnitude of low-frequency GMST variability is likely to decline in a warmer climate and that its generating mechanisms may be fundamentally altered. In particular, a warmer climate results in lower albedo at high latitudes, which yields a weaker albedo feedback on unforced GMST variability. These results imply that unforced GMST variability is dependent on the background climatological conditions, and thus climate model control simulations run under perpetual pre-industrial conditions may have only limited relevance for understanding the unforced GMST variability of the future.",

We further show that the contribution of these cropping systems to China's total rice production has shifted dramatically over recent decades. We estimate that if the present structure of rice cropping systems persists, warming will reduce China's total rice production by 5.0% in 2060. However, if the recent decline in the area of double rice systems continues, China's rice production may decrease by 13.5%.

To estimate future global risk of extreme heat with humidity on health, we calculate indicators of heat stress that have been commonly used: the Heat Index, the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature and the Wet-Bulb Temperature, from the latest Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) projections. We analyse how and where different levels of heat stress hazards will change, from severe to deadly, and how results are sensitive to the choice of the index used. We evaluate this risk at country-level and use population and GDPPPP growth scenario to estimate the vulnerability of each nation. Consistent with previous studies, we find that South and East Asia, and the Middle-East, are highly exposed to heat stress hazards, and that this exposure increases by 20%\u201360% with global mean temperature change from 1.5 to 3\u2009∘C. However, we also find substantial increases in heat health risk for some vulnerable countries with less adaptive capacity, such as West Africa, and Central and South America. For these regions, about 20 to more than 50% of the population could be exposed to severe heat stress each year on average, independent of the index used. For global warming of 3∘, European countries and the USA will also be exposed several times per year to conditions with daily mean heat stress level equal to the maximum heat stress of the 2003 heat wave.",

To provide more detailed representations of climate processes and impacts, the spatial resolution was N216 (approx. 60 km grid length in mid-latitudes), a higher resolution than the CMIP5 models. We used a set of impacts-relevant indices and a global land surface model to examine the projected changes in weather extremes and their implications for freshwater availability and vulnerability to food insecurity. Uncertainties in regional climate responses are assessed, examining ranges of outcomes in impacts to inform risk assessments. Despite some degree of inconsistency between components of the study due to the need to correct for systematic biases in some aspects, the outcomes from different ensemble members could be compared for several different indicators. The projections for weather extremes indices and biophysical impacts quantities support expectations that the magnitude of change is generally larger for 2°C global warming than 1.5°C. Hot extremes become even hotter, with increases being more intense than seen in CMIP5 projections. Precipitation-related extremes show more geographical variation with some increases and some decreases in both heavy precipitation and drought. There are substantial regional uncertainties in hydrological impacts at local scales due to different climate models producing different outcomes. Nevertheless, hydrological impacts generally point towards wetter conditions on average, with increased mean river flows, longer heavy rainfall events, particularly in South and East Asia with the most extreme projections suggesting more than a doubling of flows in the Ganges at 2°C global warming. Some areas are projected to experience shorter meteorological drought events and less severe low flows, although longer droughts and/or decreases in low flows are projected in many other areas, particularly southern Africa and South America. Flows in the Amazon are projected to decline by up to 25\\%. Increases in either heavy rainfall or drought events imply increased vulnerability to food insecurity, but if global warming is limited to 1.5°C, this vulnerability is projected to remain smaller than at 2°C global warming in approximately 76\\% of developing countries. At 2°C, four countries are projected to reach unprecedented levels of vulnerability to food insecurity.This article is part of the theme issue \u2018The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels\u2019.",

Furthermore, extensive terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) through managed biomass growth and subsequent carbon capture and storage is required to avoid temperature \u201Covershoot\u201D in most pertinent scenarios. Here, we address two major issues: First, we calculate the extent of tCDR required to \u201Crepair\u201D delayed or insufficient emissions reduction policies unable to prevent global mean temperature rise of 2.5°C or even 4.5°C above pre\u2010industrial level. Our results show that those tCDR measures are unable to counteract \u201Cbusiness\u2010as\u2010usual\u201D emissions without eliminating virtually all natural ecosystems. Even if considerable (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 RCP4.5) emissions reductions are assumed, tCDR with 50% storage efficiency requires >1.1\u2009Gha of the most productive agricultural areas or the elimination of >50% of natural forests. In addition, >100\u2009MtN/yr fertilizers would be needed to remove the roughly 320\u2009GtC foreseen in these scenarios. Such interventions would severely compromise food production and/or biosphere functioning. Second, we reanalyze the requirements for achieving the 160\u2013190\u2009GtC tCDR that would complement strong mitigation action (RCP2.6) in order to avoid 2°C overshoot anytime. We find that a combination of high irrigation water input and/or more efficient conversion to stored carbon is necessary. In the face of severe trade\u2010offs with society and the biosphere, we conclude that large\u2010scale tCDR is not a viable alternative to aggressive emissions reduction. However, we argue that tCDR might serve as a valuable \u201Csupporting actor\u201D for strong mitigation if sustainable schemes are established immediately.\r\n\r\nPlain Language Summary\r\nIn 2015, parties agreed to limit global warming to \u201Cwell below\u201D 2°C above pre\u2010industrial levels. However, this requires not only massive near\u2010term greenhouse gas emissions reductions but also the application of \u201Cnegative emission\u201D techniques that extract already emitted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Specifically, this could refer to the establishment of extensive plantations of fast\u2010growing tree and grass species in combination with biomass conversion to carbon\u2010saving products. Although such deployment is seen as promising, its carbon sequestration potentials and possible side\u2010effects still remain to be studied in depth. In this study, we analyzed two feasibility aspects of such a negative emissions approach using biomass plantations and carbon utilization pathways. First, we show that biomass plantations with subsequent carbon immobilization are likely unable to \u201Crepair\u201D insufficient emission reduction policies without compromising food production and biosphere functioning due to its space\u2010consuming properties. Second, the requirements for a strong mitigation scenario staying below the 2°C target would require a combination of high irrigation water input and development of highly effective carbon process chains. Although we find that this strategy of sequestering carbon is not a viable alternative to aggressive emission reductions, it could still support mitigation efforts if sustainably managed.",

However, some species' flowering times have changed much more than others. Data at the community level can clarify the variation in flowering responses to climate change. In order to determine how North American species' flowering times respond to climate, we analyzed a series of previously unstudied records of the dates of first flowering for over 500 plant taxa in Concord, Massachusetts, USA. These records began with six years of observations by the famous naturalist Henry David Thoreau from 1852 to 1858, continued with 16 years of observations by the botanist Alfred Hosmer in 1878 and 1888-1902, and concluded with our own observations in 2004, 2005, and 2006. From 1852 through 2006, Concord warmed by 2.4 degrees C due to global climate change and urbanization. Using a subset of 43 common species, we determined that plants are now flowering seven days earlier on average than they did in Thoreau's times. Plant flowering times were most correlated with mean temperatures in the one or two months just before flowering and were also correlated with January temperatures. Summer-flowering species showed more interannual variation in flowering time than did spring-flowering species, but the flowering times of spring-flowering species correlated more strongly to mean monthly temperatures. In many cases, such as within the genera Betula and Solidago, closely related, co-occurring species responded to climate very differently from one another. The differences in flowering responses to warming could affect relationships in plant communities as warming continues. Common St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) are particularly responsive to changes in climate, are common across much of the United States, and could serve as indicators of biological responses to climate change. We discuss the need for researchers to be aware, when using data sets involving multiple observers, of how varying methodologies, sample sizes, and sampling intensities affect the results. Finally, we emphasize the importance of using historical observations, like those of Thoreau and Hosmer, as sources of long-term data and to increase public awareness of biological responses to climate change.",

         "volume": "27","number": "12","pages": "4677--4692","abstract": "AbstractThe importance of investigating regional climate changes associated with degrees of global warming is increasingly being recognized, but the majority of relevant research has been based on multimodel ensembles (MMEs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). This has left two important questions unanswered: Are there plausible futures which are not represented by the models in CMIP? And, how would regional climates evolve under enhanced global warming, beyond 4°C? In this paper, two perturbed physics ensembles (PPEs) are used to address these issues with reference to African precipitation. Examination of model versions that generate warming greater than 4°C in the twenty-first century shows that changes in African precipitation are enhanced gradually, even to high global temperatures; however, there may be nonlinearities that are not incorporated here due to limited model complexity. The range of projections from the PPEs is compared to data from phases 3 and 5 of CMIP (CMIP3 and CMIP5), revealing regional differences. This is partly the result of implausible model versions, but the PPE dataset can be justifiably constrained given its size and systematic nature, highlighting an additional advantage over MMEs. After applying constraints, the PPEs still show changes that are outside the range of CMIP, most prominently strong dry signals in west equatorial Africa and the Sahel, implying that MMEs may underestimate risks for these regions. Analysis of African precipitation changes therefore demonstrates that regional assessments that rely on CMIP3 and CMIP5 may overlook uncertainties associated with model parameterizations and pronounced warming. More systematic approaches are needed for conservative estimates of danger.",

Our investigation shows the good positive correlations\nbetween the Earth's surface Ultraviolet irradiance (280-400 nm) and the Earth's\nsurface temperature both in temporal and spatial variations by analyzing the\nglobal surface Ultraviolet irradiance (280-400 nm) and global surface\ntemperature data from 1980-1999. The rise of CO\\$\\_2\\$ cannot interpret the good\npositive correlations, and we could even get an opposite result to the good\ncorrelations when employing the rise of CO\\$\\_2\\$ to describe the relation between\nthem. Based on the good positive correlations, we suggest a new effect, named\n\"Highly Excited Water Vapor\" (HEWV) effect, which can interpret how the Sun\ninfluences the Earth's surface temperature reasonably, including the rapid\nwarming after 1970s.",

         "volume": "6","number": "2","pages": "2447--2505","abstract": "Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Currently, two such levels are discussed in the context of the international climate negotiations as long-term global temperature goals: a below 2 °C and a 1.5 °C limit in global-mean temperature rise above pre-industrial levels. Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive assessment of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between 1.5 °C and 2 °C. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 \\% in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 \\% by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and several hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 to 17 \\% between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 \\% longer to 11 \\%. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and Northern South America are projected to face local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels under a 2 °C warming, which is about 10 cm lower for a 1.5 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess future climate risks as well as different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a solid foundation for future work on refining our understanding of warming-level dependent climate impacts.",

         "pages": "n/a","abstract": "This paper studies how the anthropogenic-induced global warming affects the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) by using 26 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models. The simulated present-day EAWM is evaluated and future projections under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios are presented in terms of the climatology and interannual variability. All 26 models can well reproduce the spatial pattern of EAWM climatology and 16 out of the 26 models can reasonably capture major features of interannual variability. The projection made by 26-model ensemble mean indicate that winter surface air temperature averaged over 20°\u201360°N, 100°\u2013140°E will increase by 3\u2009°C in RCP4.5 and 5.5\u2009°C in RCP8.5 towards the end of the 21st century. The corresponding regional mean precipitation will increase by 12.3\\% in RCP4.5 and 21.8\\% in RCP8.5. The strong warming over high-latitude North Pacific due to melting sea ice in the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea leads to significant intensification and a northward shift of the Aleutian Low, resulting in prominent increase in the low-level northerly along the coastal regions of northeastern Asia. At 500\u2009hPa the characteristic East Asian Trough is projected to weaken slightly and tilt more eastward with latitude. The selected 16-model ensemble mean projects future enhanced interannual variability of surface air temperature and sea-level pressure over mid-latitude North Pacific and high-latitude East Asia (EA) and reduced variability over eastern China, suggesting that the EAWM will be more variable in the high-latitude EA and mid-latitude North Pacific but less variable in East China. Accordingly, the year-to-year precipitation variability will be significantly enhanced over high-latitude EA. Majority of the 26 models project that the leading mode of EAWM interannual variation (the 'northern mode') will become more dominant in the warmer climate.",

         "abstract": "The commitment to limit warming to 1.5°C as set out in the Paris Agreement is widely regarded as ambitious and challenging. It has been proposed that reaching this target may require a number of actions, which could include some form of carbon removal or Solar Radiation Management in addition to strong emission reductions. Here we assess one theoretical solution using Solar Radiation Management to limit global mean warming to 1.5°C above pre\u2010industrial temperatures, and use the McArthur fire danger index to evaluate the change in fire danger. The results show that globally fire danger is reduced in most areas when temperatures are limited to 1.5°C compared to 2.0°C. The number of days where fire danger is 'high' or above is reduced by up to 30 days per year on average, although there are regional variations. In certain regions, fire danger is increased, experiencing 31 more days above 'high' fire danger.",

In many models, the number of intense surface cyclones (sea-level pressure below 980 hPa) increases on the polar and downstream side of the storm tracks, and the mean growth rate of the cyclones is enhanced in areas upstream of these regions, especially in the North Pacific. Around these regions, the mean growth rate is highly correlated with the upper-level zonal wind on a monthly time scale, and its projected change can be largely explained by the zonal wind change. An enhanced polar jet over the North Pacific seen in many models leads to an enhanced mean growth rate of surface cyclones, while less agreement between the models is seen over the North Atlantic.",

But why did manufacturers turn from traditional sources of power, notably water mills, to an engine fired by coal? Contrary to established views, steam offered neither cheaper nor more abundant energy\u2014but rather superior control of subordinate labour. Animated by fossil fuels, capital could concentrate production at the most profitable sites and during the most convenient hours, as it continues to do today. Sweeping from nineteenth-century Manchester to the emissions explosion in China, from the original triumph of coal to the stalled shift to renewables, this study hones in on the burning heart of capital and demonstrates, in unprecedented depth, that turning down the heat will mean a radical overthrow of the current economic order.",

About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems2, but this absorption is sensitive to climate3, 4 as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations5, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change6. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon\u2013climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr-1 is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models2, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.",

However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions\r\n\treflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether\r\n\tnew genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the\r\n\texpansion of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe\r\n\tduring the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary\r\n\tpopulations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography\r\n\tand genetic changes associated with the range shift. Based on the\r\n\tanalysis of mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP markers, we observe\r\n\ta higher level of genetic diversity in the expanding populations,\r\n\tapparently due to admixture of formerly isolated lineages. Using\r\n\treciprocal transplant experiments for testing overwintering tolerance,\r\n\tas well as temperature preference and tolerance tests in the laboratory,\r\n\twe find that the invading spiders have possibly shifted their temperature\r\n\tniche. This may be a key adaptation for survival in Northern latitudes.\r\n\tThe museum samples allow a reconstruction of the invasion's genetic\r\n\thistory. A first, small-scale range shift started around 1930, in\r\n\tparallel with the onset of global warming. A more massive invasion\r\n\tof Northern Europe associated with genetic admixture and morphological\r\n\tchanges occurred in later decades. We suggest that the latter range\r\n\texpansion into far Northern latitudes may be a consequence of the\r\n\tadmixture that provided the genetic material for adaptations to new\r\n\tenvironmental regimes. Hence, global warming could have facilitated\r\n\tthe initial admixture of populations and this resulted in genetic\r\n\tlineages with new habitat preferences.",

         "volume": "141","number": "690","pages": "1479--1501","abstract": "This article discusses the possible response of the large-scale atmospheric structure to a warmer climate. Using integrations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) in conjunction with physical arguments, we try to identify what changes are likely to be robust and what the underlying mechanisms might be. We focus on the large-scale zonally averaged circulation, in particular on height of the tropopause, the strength and position of the surface westerlies and the strength and extent of the Hadley Cell. We present analytic arguments and numerical calculations which suggest that under global warming the height of the tropopause will increase in both the transient response and final equilibrium state, and an increase is clearly found in all the comprehensive models in CMIP5. Upper stratospheric cooling is also found in the comprehensive models, and this too can be explained by a radiative argument. Regarding the circulation, most models show a slight expansion and weakening of the Hadley Cell, depending on season and hemisphere. The expansion is small and largely confined to winter but with some expansion in Southern Hemisphere summer. The weakening occurs principally in the Northern Hemisphere but the intermodel scatter is large. There is also a general polewards shift in surface westerlies, but the changes are small and again are little larger than the intermodel variability in the change. This shift is positively correlated with the Hadley Cell expansion to a degree that depends somewhat on the metric chosen for the latter. There is a robust strengthening in the Southern Hemisphere surface winds across seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere there is a slight strengthening in the westerlies in most models in winter but a consistent weakening of the westerlies in summer. We present various physical arguments concerning these circulation changes but none that are both demonstrably correct and that account for the model results. We conclude that the above-mentioned large-scale thermodynamic/radiative changes in the large-scale atmospheric structure are generally robust, in the sense of being both well understood and consistently reproduced by comprehensive models. In that sense the dynamical changes are less robust given the current state of knowledge and simulation, although one cannot conclude that they are, in principle, unknowable or less predictable.",

We analyze changes in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1, A1B and A2 future climate scenarios relative to the PICNTRL pre-industrial control and 20C3M twentieth century simulations from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4. Comparison with observation forced land surface model estimates indicates that the models do reasonably well at replicating our best estimates of twentieth century, large scale drought occurrence, although the frequency of long-term (more than 12-month duration) droughts are over-estimated. Under the future projections, the models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4\u20136-month duration) droughts from the mid-twentieth century to the end of the twenty-first. Long-term droughts become three times more common. Regionally, the Mediterranean, west African, central Asian and central American regions show large increases most notably for long-term frequencies as do mid-latitude North American regions but with larger variation between scenarios. In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation. Although the predicted future changes in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many regions, they are generally not statistically different from contemporary climate (as estimated from the 1961\u20131990 period of the 20C3M simulations) or natural variability (as estimated from the PICNTRL simulations) for multiple decades, in contrast to primary climate variables, such as global mean surface air temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, changes in annual and seasonal means of terrestrial hydrologic variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture, are essentially undetectable within the twenty-first century. Changes in the extremes of climate and their hydrological impacts may therefore be more detectable than changes in their means.",

Roadmaps are developed and grid analyses are performed here for 145 countries to address these problems. The roadmaps call for a 100% transition of all-purpose business-as-usual (BAU) energy to wind-water-solar (WWS) energy, efficiency, and storage, ideally by 2035, but by no later than 2050, with at least 80% by 2030. Grid stability analyses find that the countries, grouped into 24 regions, can exactly match demand with 100% WWS supply and storage, from 2050\u20132052. Worldwide, WWS reduces end-use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from $17.8 to $6.6 trillion per year), and social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of ∼$61.5 trillion. The mean payback times of the capital cost due to energy- and social-cost savings are 5.5 and 0.8 years, respectively. WWS is estimated to create 28.4 million more long-term, full-time jobs than lost worldwide and may need only ∼0.17% and ∼0.36% of world land for new footprint and spacing, respectively. Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than BAU. Sensitivity test indicate the following. Increasing district heating and cooling may reduce costs by allowing flexible loads to replace inflexible loads, thereby replacing electricity storage and overgeneration with low-cost heat storage. A battery cost that is 50% higher than in the base case increases mean overall energy costs by only 3.2 (0.03\u201314.5)%. Almost all regions need fewer hours of load shifting than assumed in the base case, suggesting that actual load shifting may be easier than assumed. Increasing the use of electricity for hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles instead of for battery-electric vehicles increases overall cost in most regions tested, due to the greater efficiency of battery-electric vehicles, but decreases overall cost in some regions by improving grid stability. Finally, shifting battery vehicle charging from day-night to mostly day charging reduces cost in the regions tested; shifting to mostly night charging increases cost. Ninety-five percent of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercial.",

This study predicts future ocean wave climate in comparison with present wave climate based on the atmospheric general circulation model and global wave model. The annual averaged and extreme sea surface winds and waves are analyzed in detail. There are clear regional dependences of both annual average and also extreme wave height changes from present to future climates. The wave heights of future climate will increase at both middle latitudes and also in the Antarctic Ocean, with a decrease at the equator.",

While building a green library may represent the largest public statement any community can make to show its support for sustainability, several measures can be taken to move existing facilities in that direction. Information on the LEED-certified silver library in Fayetteville, Arkansas is presented. Numerous libraries have also moved beyond internal recycling to assuming a more public role in the battle to curb the effects of global warming.",

         "comment" : "(private-note)Bud growth cessation in the autumn is triggered strongly by night-length (so occurs about the same time every autumn) and so may occur sooner than is optimal in a warmer climate. Autumn frost hardening may occur later, but disruption of the sequencing of cooling temperatures and lengthening nights may lead to incomplete hardening. However, models of the frost hardening process are largely conceptual; few describe processes at the cell level so their predictions are uncertain. It is clear that sudden winter thaws can cause injury directly or after subsequent frost. Similarly, if early dehardening is accompanied by ontogenetic development, making rehardening more difficult, there may be increased risk of spring injury before budburst.",

However, it is unknown how these various systems will respond to such a temperature increase because their relevant spatial scales are much different than those represented by numerical global climate modelsâ\u0080\u0094the standard tool for climate change studies. This deficiency can be addressed by using higher-resolution regional climate models, but at great computational expense. The research presented here seeks to determine how a 2Â°C global-mean temperature increase might change the frequency of seasonal temperature extremes, both in the United States and around the globe, without necessarily resorting to these computationally-intensive model experiments. Results indicate that in many locations the regional temperature increases that accompany a 2Â°C increase in global mean temperatures are significantly larger than the interannual-to-decadal variations in seasonal-mean temperatures; in these locations a 2Â°C global mean temperature increase results in seasonal-mean temperatures that consistently exceed the most extreme values experienced during the second half of the 20th Century. Further, results indicate that many tropical regions, despite having relatively modest overall temperature increases, will have the most substantial increase in number of hot extremes. These results highlight that extremes very well could become the norm, even given the 2Â°C temperature increase target.",

This paper provides consistent estimates of global and regional impacts and risks at increases in global mean temperature up to 5 °C above pre-industrial levels, for over 30 indicators representing temperature extremes and heatwaves, hydrological change, floods and droughts and proxies for impacts on crop yields. At the global scale, all the impacts that could plausibly be either adverse or beneficial are adverse, and impacts and risks increase with temperature change. For example, the global average chance of a major heatwave increases from 5\\% in 1981--2010 to 28\\% at 1.5 °C and 92\\% at 4 °C, of an agricultural drought increases from 9 to 24\\% at 1.5 °C and 61\\% at 4 °C, and of the 50-year return period river flood increases from 2 to 2.4\\% at 1.5 °C and 5.4\\% at 4 °C. The chance of a damaging hot spell for maize increases from 5 to 50\\% at 4 °C, whilst the chance for rice rises from 27 to 46\\%. There is considerable uncertainty around these central estimates, and impacts and risks vary between regions. Some impacts---for example heatwaves---increase rapidly as temperature increases, whilst others show more linear responses. The paper presents estimates of the risk of impacts exceeding specific targets and demonstrates that these estimates are sensitive to the thresholds used.",

For this reason data was collected by using questionnaires and face to face interviews with 125 farmers. Results showed that total energy inputs and output were 69113.46 and 260429 MJ ha-1, respectively. Efficiency Energy Ratio (ER) was 3.77 and Energy Productivity (EP) was 0.97MJha-1. Maximum CO2 emission due to N-fertilizer inputs was 938.05 kgha-1, respectively. In sugar beet farms total CO2 production was 2777.10 kgha-1.The results also showed that the indirect and non-renewable energy sources were 76.28% and 82.36%, respectively. The high rate of non-renewable and indirect energy inputs indicate an intensive use of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, tractor and machinery and irrigation system consumption in these agro-ecosystems. Finally, giving a proper education to farmers about extension services in case of machinery combination, fertilizing, spraying and soil test, in a proper time, can have a great effect in sustainability of the sugar beet production.",

Under the A1B scenario, by 2070?99, summertime solar radiation is projected to increase by 5\\%?10\\% in central and southern Europe. In winter, radiation decreases in most of northern and eastern Europe by 5\\%?15\\%. RH drops in summer in the southern European inland by 8\\%?12\\%, whereas in winter a small increase of 2\\%?3\\% is projected for northeastern Europe. In spring, the change is an intermediate between those in the extreme seasons, while in autumn the patterns resemble summer. Over the northern Atlantic Ocean, RH increases in all seasons by 1\\%?2\\%. The intermodel agreement on the sign of all these shifts is good, and the patterns recur in the responses to the A2 and B1 scenarios. Substantial changes are already simulated to occur before the midcentury, for example, in summer RH decreases by more than 5\\% in the inner Balkan Peninsula. Projected changes in these two variables agree well and are also mainly consistent with precipitation responses both in the multimodel mean and in individual models. According to all indicators, southern European summers become more arid, while winters, in the north particularly, become moister and darker. The increasing radiation and declining RH exacerbate summertime drought in southern Europe, whereas excessive humidity in the north may, for example, inflict moisture damages in constructions.",

This temperature increase is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect due to measured increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980\u2019s. Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.",

Photosynthetic tolerance of freezing was measured for plants growing under infrared (IR) warming at 3050 m in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. In situ freezing was imposed using cold nitrogen gas (from a pressurized container of liquid nitrogen) passed through a heat exchanger placed on top of stems and leaves. Plant water potential, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, and stomatal conductance to water vapor were higher for both species on IR-warmed compared with control plots. For A. tridentata, IR warming caused enhanced tolerance of in situ freezing temperatures. There was no difference in freezing tolerance for E. grandiflorum on control vs IR plots. These results suggest that some species will not be negatively affected by freezing, whereas others may exhibit enhanced tolerance of subzero air temperatures, under a future warmer climate in which snowmelt occurs earlier in the year.",

While the Paris Agreement has set the ambitious target to limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to preindustrial levels, scientists are urged to explore scenarios for different warming thresholds and quantify ranges of socioeconomic impact. In this work, we present a framework to estimate the economic damage and population affected by river floods at global scale. It is based on a modeling cascade involving hydrological, hydraulic and socioeconomic impact simulations, and makes use of state-of-the-art global layers of hazard, exposure and vulnerability at 1-km grid resolution. An ensemble of seven high-resolution global climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 is used to derive streamflow simulations in the present and in the future climate. Those were analyzed to assess the frequency and magnitude of river floods and their impacts under scenarios corresponding to 1.5°C, 2°C, and 4°C global warming. Results indicate a clear positive correlation between atmospheric warming and future flood risk at global scale. At 4°C global warming, countries representing more than 70\\% of the global population and global gross domestic product will face increases in flood risk in excess of 500\\%. Changes in flood risk are unevenly distributed, with the largest increases in Asia, U.S., and Europe. In contrast, changes are statistically not significant in most countries in Africa and Oceania for all considered warming levels.",

It is not clear which effect\n                        would dominate. We have performed simulations of global land cover change using the NCAR CAM3 atmospheric general circulation\n                        model coupled to a slab ocean model. We find that global replacement of current vegetation by trees would lead to a global\n                        mean warming of 1.3°C, nearly 60\\% of the warming produced under a doubled CO2 concentration, while replacement by grasslands would result in a cooling of 0.4°C. It has been previously shown that boreal\n                        forestation can lead to warming; our simulations indicate that mid-latitude forestation also could lead to warming. These\n                        results suggest that more research is necessary before forest carbon storage should be deployed as a mitigation strategy for\n                        global warming.",

The theory of global warming (GW) could not be more relevant for mankind, as irreversibility probably entails human extinction. Neither the UNFCCC nor the G20 pay enough attention to the dangers of global warming. The COP23, hosted by threated Pacifc Island Fiji, must come up with the means and tools of decarbonisation, as CO2emissions must be reduced. Solar power parks will do, if backed globally.

Globally, fossil fuel subsidies were $7 trillion in 2022 or 7.1 percent of GDP. Explicit subsidies (undercharging for supply costs) have more than doubled since 2020 but are still only 18 percent of the total subsidy, while nearly 60 percent is due to undercharging for global warming and local air pollution. Differences between efficient prices and retail fuel prices are large and pervasive, for example, 80 percent of global coal consumption was priced at below half of its efficient level in 2022. Full fossil fuel price reform would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to an estimated 43 percent below baseline levels in 2030 (in line with keeping global warming to 1.5-2oC), while raising revenues worth 3.6 percent of global GDP and preventing 1.6 million local air pollution deaths per year. Accompanying spreadsheets provide detailed results for 170 countries.",

This month scientists from over 60 nations on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the first part of their latest report on global warming. In the report the panel concludes that it is very likely that most of the 0.5 °C increase in global temperature over the last 50 years is due to man-made emissions of greenhouse gases. And the science suggests that much greater changes are in store: by 2100 anthropogenic global warming could be comparable to the warming of about 6 °C since the last ice age.",

They provide some of the most effective means to achieving a range of global goals, such as addressing climate change, creating sustainable and thriving communities, and driving economic growth. The benefits of green buildings can be grouped within three categories environmental, economic and social. In this paper we concluded that the 1. Green building is an eco friendly and most importantly favorable to environment that more people need to adopt. 2. Global warming and energy crises cannot be solved in one or two years. 3. Green technology will definitely be the solution that gets the potential in helping is to solve those problems and improve our environment. 4. Building energy consumption has accounted for about 45 of final energy of society. If the building can reduce energy consumption by 50 during the process of using, then it can make a contribution that can reduce 14 of final energy of whole society. Akash S. Sonare | Pallavi B.

Climate models have shown an AMOC slowdown under anthropogenic warming since the industrial revolution2\u20134, but this slowdown has been difficult to detect in the short observational record5\u201310 because of substantial interdecadal climate variability. This has led to the indirect detection of the slowdown from longer-term fingerprints11\u201314 such as the subpolar North Atlantic \u2018warming hole\u201911. However, these fingerprints, which exhibit some uncertainties15, are all local indicators of AMOC slowdown around the subpolar North Atlantic. Here we show observational and modelling evidence of a remote indicator of AMOC slowdown outside the North Atlantic. Under global warming, the weakening AMOC reduces the salinity divergence and then leads to a \u2018salinity pile-up\u2019 remotely in the South Atlantic. This evidence is consistent with the AMOC slowdown under anthropogenic warming and, furthermore, suggests that this weakening has likely occurred all the way into the South Atlantic.",

Deforestation releases CO to the atmosphere, which exerts a warming influence on Earth's climate. However, biophysical effects of deforestation, which include changes in land surface albedo, evapotranspiration, and cloud cover also affect climate. Here we present results from several large-scale deforestation experiments performed with a three-dimensional coupled global carbon-cycle and climate model. These simulations were performed by using a fully three-dimensional model representing physical and biogeochemical interactions among land, atmosphere, and ocean. We find that global-scale deforestation has a net cooling influence on Earth's climate, because the warming carbon-cycle effects of deforestation are overwhelmed by the net cooling associated with changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. Latitude-specific deforestation experiments indicate that afforestation projects in the tropics would be clearly beneficial in mitigating global-scale warming, but would be counterproductive if implemented at high latitudes and would offer only marginal benefits in temperate regions. Although these results question the efficacy of mid- and high-latitude afforestation projects for climate mitigation, forests remain environmentally valuable resources for many reasons unrelated to climate.",

         "abstract": "While the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is expected to weaken under increasing GHGs, it is unclear how it would respond to stabilization of global warming of 1.5 or 2.0\u2009°C, the Paris Agreement temperature targets, or 3.0\u2009°C, the expected warming by 2100 under current emission reduction policies. On the basis of stabilized warming simulations with two Earth System Models, we find that, after temperature stabilization, the AMOC declines for 5\u201310\u2009years followed by a 150-year recovery to a level that is approximately independent of the considered stabilization scenario. The AMOC recovery has important implications for North Atlantic steric sea-level rise, which by 2600 is simulated to be 25\u201331% less than the global mean, and for North Atlantic surface temperatures, which continue to increase despite global mean surface temperature stabilization. These results show that substantial ongoing climate trends are likely to occur after global mean temperature has stabilized.",

These transformations can alter the Earth climate system by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use changes and by changing the reflective and energy exchange characteristics of land ecosystems. Using an integrated assessment model that links an economic model with climate, terrestrial biogeochemistry, and biogeophysics models, we examined the biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects of possible land use changes from an expanded global second-generation bioenergy program on surface temperatures over the first half of the 21st century. Our integrated assessment model shows that land clearing, especially forest clearing, has two concurrent effects\u2014increased GHG emissions, resulting in surface air warming; and large changes in the land's reflective and energy exchange characteristics, resulting in surface air warming in the tropics but cooling in temperate and polar regions. Overall, these biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects will only have a small impact on global mean surface temperature. However, the model projects regional patterns of enhanced surface air warming in the Amazon Basin and the eastern part of the Congo Basin. Therefore, global land use strategies that protect tropical forests could dramatically reduce air warming projected in these regions.",

This model, HadGEM2-ES, allows us to assess the impacts of climate change, multiple interactions, and feedbacks as the model is run. This paper discusses the results of century-scale HadGEM2-ES simulations from an impacts perspective\u2013specifically, terrestrial ecosystems and water resources\u2013for four different scenarios following the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), being used for next assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Over the 21st Century, simulated changes in global and continential-scale terrestrial ecosystems due to climate change appear to be very similar in all 4 RCPs, even though the level of global warming by the end of the 21st Century ranges from 2 °C in the lowest scenario to 5.5° in the highest. A warming climate generally favours broadleaf trees over needleleaf, needleleaf trees over shrubs, and shrubs over herbaceous vegetation, resulting in a poleward shift of temperate and boreal forests and woody tundra in all scenarios. Although climate related changes are slightly larger in scenarios of greater warming, the largest differences between scenarios arise at regional scales as a consequence of different patterns of anthropogenic land cover change. In the model, the scenario with the lowest global warming results in the most extensive decline in tropical forest cover due to a large expansion of agriculture. Under all four RCPs, fire potential could increase across extensive land areas, particularly tropical and sub-tropical latitudes. River outflows are simulated to increase with higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and global warming in all projections, with outflow increasing with mean temperature at the end of the 21st Century at the global scale and in North America, Asia, and Africa. In South America, Europe, and Australia, the relationship with climate warming and CO<sub>2</sub> rise is less clear, probably as a result of land cover change exerting a dominant effect in those regions.",

Because\n\tsuch models utilize simplified and indirect assumptions about CO2\n\tdegassing, improved quantification is warranted. Present-day CO2\n\tdegassing provides a baseline for modeling the global carbon cycle\n\tand provides insight into the geologic regimes of paleodegassing.\n\tMid-ocean ridges (MORs) discharge 1-3 x 10(12) mol/yr of CO2 and\n\tconsume similar to3.5 x 1012 mol/yr Of CO2 by carbonate formation\n\tin MOR hydrothermal systems. Excluding MORs as a net source of CO2\n\tto the atmosphere, the total CO2 discharge from subaerial volcanism\n\tis estimated at similar to2.0-2.5 x 1012 mol/yr. Because this flux\n\tis lower than estimates of the global consumption of atmospheric\n\tCO2 by subaerial silicate weathering, other CO2 sources are required\n\tto balance the global carbon cycle. Nonvolcanic CO2 degassing (i.e.,\n\temission not from the craters or flanks of volcanos), which is prevalent\n\tin high heat flow regimes that are primarily located at plate boundaries,\n\tcould contribute the additional CO2 that is apparently necessary\n\tto balance the global carbon cycle. Oxidation of methane emitted\n\tfrom serpentinization of ultramafics and from thermocatalysis of\n\torganic matter provides an additional, albeit unquantified, source\n\tof CO2 to the atmosphere. Magmatic CO2 degassing was probably a major\n\tcontributor to global warming during the Cretaceous. Metamorphic\n\tCO2 degassing from regimes of shallow, pluton-related low-pressure\n\tregional metamorphism may have significantly contributed to global\n\twarming during the Cretaceous and Paleocene/Eocene. CO2 degassing\n\tassociated with continental rifting of Pangaea may have contributed\n\tto the global warming that was initiated in the Jurassic. During\n\tthe Cretaceous, global warming initiated by CO2 degassing of flood\n\tbasalts, and consequent rapid release of large quantities of CH4\n\tby decomposition of gas hydrates (clathrates), could have caused\n\twidespread extinctions of organisms.",

The global environment is affected by the various activities and conditions of different countries of the world like increasing industrial practices, population, etc. and these activities adversely affects the natural resources of the global environment like land, fossil fuels, etc. Two major causes were reported against the environment and they were global warming and energy crisis. The global issues related to the environment occurred due to the excessive emission of the green house gases. The green house gases are the harmful gases that results in the increasing surface temperature of the earth and thus resulting in the global warming. The carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are some of the green house gases out of which the methane is the most powerful whereas the carbon dioxide s maximum emitted by the human activities.",

Global warming will exacerbate the destruction of cultural resources in coastal zones through accelerated sea level rise, intensified storm cycles, and related coastal erosion. Although average global sea levels have been rising for ∼20,000 years, they slowed dramatically about 7,000 years ago. Rates of sea level rise now appear to be increasing rapidly due to growing anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Global warming and rising seas, especially when combined with population growth and the implementation of measures designed to protect endangered coastal properties, threaten the deep maritime history of human migrations, settlement, and adaptations in coastal areas around the world. Ranging in age from the mid-Pleistocene to recent historic times, coastal archaeological sites contain invaluable data on ancient coastal societies, fisheries, and ecosystems. Archaeologists, historians, and other cultural resource managers must do more to anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of global warming, sea level rise, and coastal erosion on the long history of human maritime cultures.",

Therefore, many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1.5 °C. Here we analyse integrated energy\u2013economy\u2013environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5 °C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios, energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 °C-consistent scenarios, but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors, leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 °C- to a 1.5 °C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO2. This implies an earlier transition to net zero carbon emissions worldwide, to be achieved between 2045 and 2060. Energy efficiency and stringent early reductions are key to retain a possibility for limiting warming to below 1.5 °C by 2100. The window for achieving this goal is small and rapidly closing.",

         "volume": "234","pages": "S10","abstract": "Wildland fires burn several hundred million hectares of vegetation every year, and increased fire activity has been reported in many global regions. Many of these fires have had serious negative impacts on human safety, health, regional economies, global climate change, and ecosystems in non-fire\u2013prone biomes. Worldwide fire suppression expenditures are rapidly increasing in an attempt to limit the impact of wildland fires. To mitigate fire-related problems and costs, forest and land management agencies, as well as land owners and communities, require anearly warning system to identify critical periods of extreme fire danger in advance of their potential occurrence. Early warning of these conditions allows fire managers to implement fire prevention, detection, and pre-suppression plans before fire problems begin. Fire danger rating is commonly used to provide early warning of the potential for serious wildfires based on daily weather data. Fire danger information is often enhanced with satellite data, such as hot spots for early fire detection, and with spectral data on land cover and fuel conditions. Normally, these systems provide a 4- to 6-hour early warning of the highest fire danger for any particular day that the weather data is supplied. However, by using forecasted weather data, as much as 2 weeks of early warning can be provided. This paper presents a proposed Global Early Warning System for Wildland Fire to provide advanced early warning capabilities at local to global levels.",

We calculate climate responses in terms of global mean temperature and find large differences between the transport sectors with respect to the size and mix of short- and long-lived effects, and even the sign of the temperature response. For year 2000 emissions, road transport has the largest effect on global mean temperature. After 20 and 100 years the response in net temperature is 7 and 6 times higher, respectively, than for aviation. Aviation and shipping have strong but quite uncertain short-lived warming and cooling effects, respectively, that dominate during the first decades after the emissions. For shipping the net cooling during the first 4 decades is due to emissions of SO2 and NOx. On a longer timescale, the current emissions from shipping cause net warming due to the persistence of the CO2 perturbation. If emissions stay constant at 2000 levels, the warming effect from road transport will continue to increase and will be almost 4 times larger than that of aviation by the end of the century.",

         "abstract": "Abstract The response over West Africa to uniform warming of the Atlantic Ocean is analyzed using idealized simulations with a regional climate model. With warming of 1 K and 1.5 K, rainfall rates increase by 30-50\\% over most of West Africa. With Atlantic warming of 2 K and higher, coastal precipitation increases but Sahel rainfall decreases substantially. This nonlinear response in Sahel rainfall is the focus of the analysis. Atlantic warming is accompanied by decreases in low-level geopotential heights in the Gulf of Guinea and decreases in the large-scale meridional geopotential height gradient. This leads to easterly wind anomalies in the central Sahel. With Atlantic warming below 2 K, these easterly anomalies support moisture transport from the Gulf of Guinea and precipitation increases. With Atlantic warming over 2 K, the easterly anomalies reverse the westerly flow over the Sahel. The resulting dry air advection into the Sahel reduces precipitation. Increased low-level moisture provides moist static energy to initiate convection with Atlantic warming at 1.5 K and below, while decreased moisture and stable thermal profiles suppress convection with additional warming. In all of each simulation, the southerly monsoon flow onto the Guinean coast is maintained and precipitation in that region increases. The relevance of these results to the global warming problem is limited by the focus on Atlantic warming alone. However, confident prediction of climate change requires an understanding of the physical processes of change, and this paper contributes to that goal.",

Satellite-observed night lights are used to identify measurement stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and periurban stations for nonclimatic factors, verifying that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Niño-La Niña cycle of tropical ocean temperature. Record high global 12 month running mean temperature for the period with instrumental data was reached in 2010.",

Rising CO2 may counter that trend by improving plant water-use efficiency4,5. However, it is not clear how important this CO2-enhanced water use efficiency might be in offsetting warming-induced desiccation because higher CO2 also leads to higher plant biomass, and therefore greater transpirational surface2,6,7. Furthermore, although warming is predicted to favour warm-season, C4 grasses, rising CO2 should favour C3, or cool-season plants8. Here we show in a semi-arid grassland that elevated CO2 can completely reverse the desiccating effects of moderate warming. Although enrichment of air to 600\u2009p.p.m.v. CO2 increased soil water content (SWC), 1.5/3.0\u2009°C day/night warming resulted in desiccation, such that combined CO2 enrichment and warming had no effect on SWC relative to control plots. As predicted, elevated CO2 favoured C3 grasses and enhanced stand productivity, whereas warming favoured C4 grasses. Combined warming and CO2 enrichment stimulated above-ground growth of C4 grasses in 2 of 3\u2009years when soil moisture most limited plant productivity. The results indicate that in a warmer, CO2-enriched world, both SWC and productivity in semi-arid grasslands may be higher than previously expected.",

Globally, rapid land surface warming since the 1970s is reproduced by some models but others warm too slowly. In the tropics, air-sea coupling allows models to reproduce the Southern Oscillation but its strength varies between models. We find a strong relationship between the Southern Oscillation in global temperature and the rate of global warming, which could in principle be used to identify models with realistic climate sensitivity. This relationship and a weak response to ENSO suggests weak sensitivity to changes in sea surface temperature in some of the models used here. In the tropics, most models reproduce part of the observed Sahel drought. In the extratropics, models do not reproduce the observed increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation in response to forcings, through internal variability, or as a combination of both.",

However, several regional climate impacts depend on the atmospheric circulation, whose response to climate change remains substantially uncertain and not interpretable in a probabilistic sense in multimodel ensemble projections. To account for these uncertainties, a novel approach where regional climate change is analyzed as a function of carbon emissions conditional on plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation change is here presented and applied to the CMIP5 models? future projections. The different storylines are determined based on the response in three remote drivers of regional circulation: the tropical and polar amplification of global warming and changes in stratospheric vortex strength. As an illustration of this approach, it is shown that the severity of the projected wintertime Mediterranean precipitation decline and central European windiness increase strongly depends on the storyline of circulation change. For a given magnitude of global warming, the highest impact storyline for these aspects of European climate is found for a high tropical amplification and a strengthening of the vortex. The difference in the precipitation and wind responses between the storylines is substantial and equivalent to the contribution from several degrees of global warming. Improving the understanding of the remote driver responses is thus needed to better bound the projected regional impacts in the European sector. The value of these storylines to represent the uncertainty in regional climate projections and to inform the selection of CMIP5 models in regional climate impact studies is discussed.",

The ensemble simulation is based on the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology climate model, ECHAM6, where all members have been exposed to the identically same radiative forcing. The range of global mean surface temperature warming over the 1850--2005 period, based on all members, is 0.65--1.10 °C. The distribution of the global mean surface temperature about the ensemble mean has a standard deviation (StD) of ˜þinspace0.14 °C which slowly decreases in time. Regionally, the largest decrease in the ensemble StD occurs in the Northern Hemisphere winter. Comparing the temporal StD with that from the observed HadCRUT4 surface temperature data indicates that the majority of the ensemble members have a larger temporal StD than the observations suggesting that the model simulations might overestimate the variance. There are clear random 20-year linear trends in global mean surface temperature anomalies as well as significant regional 50-year linear trends. Even with an ensemble mean warming trend, typical of the early twenty-first century, a global hiatus in temperature of 20 years duration is possible to occur by chance. The results support the view that observed decadal and multi-decadal anomalies in the twentieth century were significantly influenced by internal processes of the climate system. This is particularly the case for the observed global warming trend of 1910--1940 and the global cooling trend of 1940--1970. Global mean precipitation hardly increases with time in the ensemble simulations, but in agreement with theory regional changes occur, with increasing precipitation in polar regions and in some tropical areas. In the subtropics there are reductions in precipitation. Long-lasting regional anomalies of significant amplitudes occur by chance in the ensemble integration.",

Using spatially explicit sea-level estimates for the next 2000 years and high-resolution topography data, we compute which current cultural heritage sites will be affected by sea-level rise at different levels of sustained future warming. As indicators for the pressure on future cultural heritage we estimate the percentage of each country\u2019s area loss, and the percentage of current population living in regions that will be permanently below sea level, for different temperature levels. If the current global mean temperature was sustained for the next two millennia, about 6\\% (40 sites) of the UNESCO sites will be affected, and 0.7\\% of global land area will be below mean sea level. These numbers increase to 19\\% (136 sites) and 1.1\\% for a warming of 3 K. At this warming level, 3\u201312 countries will experience a loss of more than half of their current land surface, 25\u201336 countries lose at least 10\\% of their territory, and 7\\% of the global population currently lives in regions that will be below local sea level.

However, some aspects of the Earth system, such as global mean temperatures1 and sea level rise due to thermal expansion2 or the melting of large ice sheets3, continue to respond long after the stabilization of radiative forcing. Here we use a coupled climate\u2013vegetation model to show that in turn the terrestrial biosphere shows significant inertia in its response to climate change. We demonstrate that the global terrestrial biosphere can continue to change for decades after climate stabilization. We suggest that ecosystems can be committed to long-term change long before any response is observable: for example, we find that the risk of significant loss of forest cover in Amazonia rises rapidly for a global mean temperature rise above 2 °C. We conclude that such committed ecosystem changes must be considered in the definition of dangerous climate change, and subsequent policy development to avoid it.",

Multiple avenues pose threats like never before; global warming with melting of arctic ice, raging fires in Amazon and Australia, humanitarian crisis of refugees, civil war in Libya and other parts of the world pose threats to the very Human existence. The very ecology is threatened on multiple frontiers due to these challenges. None the less, associated with this Health crisis of humongous proportions is causing catastrophe in various ways.  As the world advances and countries strive to keep pace with development, the cut throat competition has worsened the health crisis more than ever. Imbalances brought by humans are no longer sustained by Mother Nature. As the environment changes rapidly Nature is unleashing its fury on us, and what could be truer in today\u2019s world gripped by a Pandemic that\u2019s unleashing its wrath. Looking back, we will see Gandhiji\u2019s simplicity in laying down models for health and hygiene are more realistic and true than ever.

Globally, rapid land surface warming since the 1970s is reproduced by some models but others warm too slowly. In the tropics, air-sea coupling allows models to reproduce the Southern Oscillation but its strength varies between models. We find a strong relationship between the Southern Oscillation in global temperature and the rate of global warming, which could in principle be used to identify models with realistic climate sensitivity. This relationship and a weak response to ENSO suggests weak sensitivity to changes in sea surface temperature in some of the models used here. In the tropics, most models reproduce part of the observed Sahel drought. In the extratropics, models do not reproduce the observed increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation in response to forcings, through internal variability, or as a combination of both.",

A key assumption is that the climate sensitivity inferred today also applies to the distant future. Yet, global climate models robustly show that feedbacks vary over time, with a strong tendency for climate sensitivity to increase as equilibrium is approached9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Here I consider the implications of inconstant climate feedbacks for energy budget constraints on climate sensitivity. I find that the long-term value of climate sensitivity is, on average, 26\\% above that inferred during transient warming within global climate models, with a larger discrepancy when climate sensitivity is high. Moreover, model values of climate sensitivity inferred during transient warming are found to be consistent with energy budget observations1, 2, 3, indicating that the models are not overly sensitive. Using model-based estimates of how climate feedbacks will change in the future, in conjunction with recent energy budget constraints1, 19, produces a current best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.9\u2009°C (1.7\u20137.1\u2009°C, 90\\% confidence). These findings suggest that climate sensitivity estimated from global energy budget constraints is in agreement with values derived from other methods and simulated by global climate models.",

This study was conducted to examine responses of plant N relationship (i.e. leaf N concentration, N use efficiency, and plant N content in this study) to a 4-year experimental warming in a tallgrass prairie in the central Great Plains in USA. We measured mass-based N and carbon (C) concentrations of stem, green, and senescent leaves, and calculated N resorption efficiency, N use efficiency, plant N content, and C : N ratios of five dominant species (two C4 grasses, one C3 grass, and two C3 forbs). The results showed that warming decreased N concentration of both green and senescent leaves, and N resorption efficiency for all species. N use efficiencies and C : N ratios were accordingly higher under warming than control. Total plant N content increased under warming because of warming-induced increases in biomass production that are larger than the warming-induced decreases in tissue N concentration. The increases in N contents in both green and senescent plant tissues suggest that warming enhanced both plant N uptake and return through litterfall in the tallgrass ecosystem. Our results also suggest that the increased N use efficiency in C4 grasses is a primary mechanism leading to increased biomass production under warming in the grassland ecosystem.",

We use two future scenarios \u2013 the IPCC SRES A1B scenario, and a climate stabilisation scenario (2C20), allowing us to assess the impact of climate mitigation on results. We performed a pair of simulations under each scenario \u2013 one in which vegetation was fixed at the initial state and one in which vegetation changes dynamically in response to climate change, as determined by the interactive vegetation model within HadCM3C. <br><br> In our simulations with interactive vegetation, relatively small changes in global vegetation coverage were found, mainly dominated by increases in shrub and needleleaf trees at high latitudes and losses of broadleaf trees and grasses across the Amazon. Globally this led to a loss of terrestrial carbon, mainly from the soil. Global changes in carbon storage were related to the regional losses from the Amazon and gains at high latitude. Regional differences in carbon storage between the two scenarios were largely driven by the balance between warming-enhanced decomposition and altered vegetation growth. Globally, interactive vegetation reduced albedo acting to enhance albedo changes due to climate change. This was mainly related to the darker land surface over high latitudes (due to vegetation expansion, particularly during December\u2013January and March\u2013May); small increases in albedo occurred over the Amazon. As a result, there was a relatively small impact of vegetation change on most global annual mean climate variables, which was generally greater under A1B than 2C20, with markedly stronger local-to-regional and seasonal impacts. Globally, vegetation change amplified future annual temperature increases by 0.24 and 0.15 K (under A1B and 2C20, respectively) and increased global precipitation, with reductions in precipitation over the Amazon and increases over high latitudes. In general, changes were stronger over land \u2013 for example, global temperature changes due to interactive vegetation of 0.43 and 0.28 K under A1B and 2C20, respectively. Regionally, the warming influence of future vegetation change in our simulations was driven by the balance between driving factors. For instance, reduced tree cover over the Amazon reduced evaporation (particularly during June\u2013August), outweighing the cooling influence of any small albedo changes. In contrast, at high latitudes the warming impact of reduced albedo (particularly during December\u2013February and March\u2013May) due to increased vegetation cover appears to have offset any cooling due to small evaporation increases. <br><br> Climate mitigation generally reduced the impact of vegetation change on future global and regional climate in our simulations. Our study therefore suggests that there is a need to consider both biogeochemical and biophysical effects in climate adaptation and mitigation decision making.",

         "volume": "7","number": "9","pages": "2639--2653","abstract": "Paddy fields are an important source of atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>, the second most important greenhouse gas. There is a strong concern that the increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (CO<sub>2</sub>) and global warming are further stimulating CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, but the magnitude of this stimulation varies substantially by study, and few open-field evaluations have been conducted. Here we report results obtained at a Japanese rice free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE) site under water and soil temperature elevation during two growing seasons. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of high CO<sub>2</sub> (ambient + 200 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>) and elevated soil temperature (+ 2 °C) on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions under completely open-field conditions. We found about 80\\% enhancement in total seasonal emissions by the additive effects of FACE and warming, indicating a strong positive feedback effect of global warming. The enhancement in CH<sub>4</sub> emission from the FACE-effect alone (+ 26\\%) was statistically non-significant (<i>P</i> = 0.19). Nevertheless, observed positive correlations between CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and rice biomass agreed well with previous studies, suggesting that higher photosynthesis led to greater rhizodeposition, which then acted as substrates for methanogenesis. Soil warming increased the emission by 44\\% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), which was equivalent to a <i>Q</i><sub>10</sub> of 5.5. Increased rice biomass by warming could only partly explain the enhanced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, but stoichiometric analysis of the electron budget indicated that even a moderate enhancement in organic matter decomposition due to soil warming can cause a large increase in CH<sub>4</sub> production under conditions where Fe(III) reduction, which was little affected by soil warming, dominates electron-accepting processes. At later rice growth stages, advanced root senescence due to elevated temperature probably provided more substrate for methanogenesis. Our stoichiometric evaluation showed that in situ Fe reduction characteristics and root turnover in response to elevated temperature should be understood to correctly predict future CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields under a changing climate. Challenges remain for determination of in situ root-exudation rate and its response to FACE and warming.",

From knowledge of the relative contributions of greenhouse gases and other forcings to observed temperature change it is possible to infer the likely rates of future warming, consistent with past observed temperature changes. Probabilistic forecasts of future warming rates in six continental-scale regions have been calculated by assuming that there is a linear relationship between past and future fractional error in temperature change on these spatial scales. All regions are expected to warm over the next century with the largest uncertainty in future warming rates being in North America and Europe. More tightly constrained predictions are obtained if it is assumed that fractional errors in global mean temperature change scale the regional projections.",

Strengthening of the NAO in recent decades has altered surface climate in these regions at a rate far in excess of global mean warming. However, only weak NAO trends are reproduced in climate simulations of the 20th Century, even with prescribed climate forcings and historical sea\u2010surface conditions. Here we show that the unexplained strengthening of the NAO can be fully simulated in a climate model by imposing observed trends in the lower stratosphere. This implies that stratospheric variability needs to be reproduced in models to fully simulate surface climate variations in the North Atlantic sector. Despite having little effect on global mean warming, we show that downward coupling of observed stratospheric circulation changes to the surface can account for the majority of change in regional surface climate over Europe and North America between 1965 and 1995.",

In human history, wars and plagues have done so on more than one occasion, and misguided ideologies and totalitarian regimes have darkened an entire era or a region. Advances in technology are adding dangers of a new kind. It could happen again. In Global Catastrophic Risks 25 leading experts look at the gravest risks facing humanity in the 21st century, including asteroid impacts, gamma-ray bursts, Earth-based natural catastrophes, nuclear war, terrorism, global warming, biological weapons, totalitarianism, advanced nanotechnology, general artificial intelligence, and social collapse. The book also addresses over-arching issues - policy responses and methods for predicting and managing catastrophes.",

Here, we combine observations of precipitation, temperature and tree cover with high-resolution comprehensive climate model simulations to investigate the combined effect of global warming and a potential Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapse on the Amazon. Our results show that, while strong warming lead to forest dieback, an Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapse would stabilize the Amazon by increasing rainfall and decreasing temperature in most parts. Although an Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapse would have devastating impacts globally, our results suggest that it may delay or even prevent parts of the Amazon rainforest from dieback. Besides the many negative consequences of its collapse, the interactions we identify here make a tipping cascade, i.e., that an Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapse would trigger Amazon dieback, appear less plausible.",

If global-scale disturbances are generated in the troposphere, they propagate upward into the stratosphere, where the waves act to decelerate the polar night jet through the induction of a meridional circulation. Thus, the distortion and the break-down of the polar vortex occur. If the disturbance is intense and persists, the westerly jet may eventually disappear and an easterly wind may replace it. Then ?critical layer interaction? takes place. Further intensification of the easterly wind and rapid warming of the polar air are expected to occur as well as weakening of the disturbance. The model is verified by numerical integrations of the adiabatic-geostrophic potential vorticity equation. Computed results possess features similar to those observed in sudden warming phenomena.",

If we still rely on the conventional electric air conditioning it will be harmful in future because electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the greenhouse gas emission would continuously worsen global warming, in turn the demand of air conditioning would be further increasing. Also the rate of electricity is increased by 6 which will goes on increasing in future. The solar powered air conditioners which are available in market are direct current air conditioners, we are designing a system for running a current air conditioner on solar which runs on alternate current. So in order to reduce the global warming and the green house gas emission effect we should adopt the natural way for the generation of electricity which in turn reduces the cost of electricity by conventional way. As the temperature of the earth is increasing day by day, the need of cooling is also increasing. But the bitter truth is that the temperature of earth is always goes on increasing. So in future there should be the need of centralized air conditioning. And as temperature increases we will get more amount of solar energy.

Soot aerosols represent a major research focus as they influence climate by absorbing incoming solar radiation resulting in a highly uncertain warming effect. The uncertainty stems from the fact that the actual amount soot warms our atmosphere strongly depends on the manner and degree in which it is mixed with other species, a property referred to as mixing state. In global models and inferences from atmospheric heating measurements, soot radiative forcing estimates currently differ by a factor of 6, ranging between 0.2-1.2 W/m(2), making soot second only to CO2 in terms of global warming potential. This article reports coupled in situ measurements of the size-resolved mixing state, optical properties, and aging timescales for soot particles. Fresh fractal soot particles dominate the measured absorption during peak traffic periods (6-9 AM local time). Immediately after sunrise, soot particles begin to age by developing a coating of secondary species including sulfate, ammonium, organics, nitrate, and water. Based on these direct measurements, the core-shell arrangement results in a maximum absorption enhancement of 1.6 x over fresh soot. These atmospheric observations help explain the larger values for soot forcing measured by others and will be used to obtain closure in optical property measurements to reduce one of the largest remaining uncertainties in climate change.",

The\r\nLyman Break Analogs (LBAs) are similar in mass, metallicity, dust, SFR, size\r\nand gas velocity dispersion, thus enabling a detailed investigation of\r\nprocesses that are important at high-z. The optical emission line properties of\r\nLBAs are also similar to those of LBGs, indicating comparable conditions in\r\ntheir ISM. In the UV, LBAs are characterized by complexes of massive\r\nstar-forming &quot;clumps&quot;, while in the optical they most often show evidence for\r\n(post-)mergers/interactions. In 6 cases, we find an extremely massive (&gt;10^9\r\nMsun) compact (R~100 pc) dominant central object (DCO). The DCOs are\r\npreferentially found in LBAs with the highest mid-IR luminosities and\r\ncorrespondingly high SFRs (15-100 Msun/yr). We show that the massive SF clumps\r\n(including the DCOs) have masses much larger than the nuclear super star\r\nclusters seen in normal late type galaxies. However, the DCOs have masses,\r\nsizes, and densities similar to the excess-light/central-cusps seen in typical\r\nelliptical galaxies with masses similar to the LBA galaxies. We suggest that\r\nthe DCOs form in present-day examples of the dissipative mergers at high\r\nredshift that are believed to have produced the central-cusps in local\r\nellipticals. More generally, the properties of the LBAs are consistent with the\r\nidea that instabilities in a gas-rich disk lead to very massive star-forming\r\nclumps that eventually coalesce to form a spheroid. We speculate that the DCOs\r\nare too young at present to be growing a supermassive black hole because they\r\nare still in a supernova-dominated outflow phase.",

         "abstract": "Observed daily precipitation and near surface air temperature data from 34 synoptic weather stations in the Philippines for the period 1951\u20132010 were subjected to trend analysis which revealed an overall warming tendency compared to the normal mean values for the period 1961\u20131990. This warming trend can be observed in the annual mean temperatures, daily minimum mean temperatures and to a lesser extent, daily maximum mean temperatures. Precipitation and temperature extremes for the period 1951\u20132010 were also analysed relative to the mean 1961\u20131990 baseline values. Some stations (Cotabato, Iloilo, Laoag and Tacloban,) show increases in both frequency and intensity of extreme daily rainfall events which are significant at the 95% level with none of the stations showing decreasing trends. The frequency of daily temperature maximum above the 99th percentile (hot days) and nights at the 1st percentile (cold nights) suggests that both days and nights in particular are becoming warmer. Such indicators of a warming trend and increase in extreme events in the Philippines are discussed in the context of similar national, regional (Asia Pacific) and global studies. The relevance of such empirically based climatology studies, particularly for nations such as the Philippines which are increasingly vulnerable to the multiple impacts of global climate change, is also considered.",

Our assessment covers criteria indicative of the ability of individual models to capture a range of large-scale processes that are important for the representation of present-day European climate. We use this study to provide examples of how this performance-based assessment may be applied to a multi-model ensemble of CMIP6 models to (a) filter the ensemble for performance against these climatological and processed-based criteria and (b) create a smaller subset of models based on performance that also maintains model diversity and the filtered projection range as far as possible.</p> <p>Filtering by excluding the least-realistic models leads to higher-sensitivity models remaining in the ensemble as an emergent consequence of the assessment. This results in both the 25th percentile and the median of the projected temperature range being shifted towards greater warming for the filtered set of models. We also weight the unfiltered ensemble against global trends. In contrast, this shifts the distribution towards less warming. This highlights a tension for regional model selection in terms of selection based on regional climate processes versus the global mean warming trend.</p>",

The PDO influence is found to dominate China drought frequency from the 1960s to early 1990s via modulating the Western Pacific Subtropical High and the Mongolian High. The four-pole drought pattern produced by the PDO diminished after the early 1990s, being replaced by a dipolar drought pattern that is produced by the AMO via a Eurasian wave train emanating from North Atlantic to China. The increasing influence of the AMO on China drought since the early 1990s is further shown to be a consequence of global warming. This study indicates that the early 1990s is a time when the Atlantic began to exert a stronger influence on climate over China and even larger part of Asia.",

However, a widely held concern is that SRM will not reverse the climate consequences of global warming evenly, resulting in regional disparities in the combined climate response to elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and SRM. Recent research has used climate model projections to quantitatively assess how regional disparities affect the overall efficiency of global SRM and what the resulting potential for cooperation and conflict with regard to SRM may be. First results indicate that regional disparities, although present, may not be severe. These assessments rest on the assumption that, for all regions, any deviation from a past climate state inflicts damages. We challenge this strong change-is-bad assumption by showing that diverging preferences are not only plausible, but may also have the potential to substantially alter assessments of regional disparities. We argue that current assessments yield little information on the ethical and political implications of SRM and that diverging preferences should receive more attention. Promising directions for future inquiry include bridging gaps to the general climate impact research and to research on the social implications of environmental change.",

In a 1000-yr control run, modeled STC variations\n\tare smaller than observed, but correlate in a similar way with low-frequency\n\tENSO-like variability. In model runs that include anthropogenically\n\tforced climate change, STC pycnocline transports decrease progressively\n\tunder the influence of global warming, attaining reductions of 8%\n\tby 2000 and 46% by 2100. Although the former reduction is insufficient\n\tto fully account for the apparent observed decline in STC transport\n\tover recent decades, it does suggest that global warming may have\n\tcontributed to the observed changes. Analysis of coupled model results\n\tshows that STC transports play a significant role in modulating tropical\n\tPacific Ocean heat content, and that such changes are dominated by\n\tanomalous currents advecting mean temperature, rather than by advection\n\tof temperature anomalies by mean currents.",

In order to limit climate warming to below 2\u2009°C, or even 1.5\u2009°C, it must undergo a rapid transition towards carbon neutral production by the mid-century. Simultaneously, electricity generating technologies will be vulnerable to climate change. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change on wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro and thermoelectric power generation in Europe using a consistent modelling approach across the different technologies. We compare the impacts for different global warming scenarios: +1.5\u2009°C, +2\u2009°C and +3\u2009°C. Results show that climate change has negative impacts on electricity production in most countries and for most technologies. Such impacts remain limited for a 1.5\u2009°C warming, and roughly double for a 3\u2009°C warming. Impacts are relatively limited for solar photovoltaic and wind power potential which may reduce up to 10\\%, while hydropower and thermoelectric generation may decrease by up to 20\\%. Generally, impacts are more severe in southern Europe than in northern Europe, inducing inequity between EU countries. We show that a higher share of renewables could reduce the vulnerability of power generation to climate change, although the variability of wind and solar PV production remains a significant challenge.",

We use high-resolution flood hazard maps derived by a 2D hydraulic model. The frequency of floods is assessed through a peak over threshold selection. An alternative to bias correcting climate projections is proposed. At 4 °C global warming, climate change could increase the flood risk by 220\\% by 2080. At the current rate of global warming, the target of limiting it within 2 degrees by the end of the century seems more and more unrealistic. Policymakers, businesses and organizations leading international negotiations urge the scientific community to provide realistic and accurate assessments of the possible consequences of so called  \u201D high end\u201D climate scenarios. This study illustrates a novel procedure to assess the future flood risk in Europe under high levels of warming. It combines ensemble projections of extreme streamflow for the current century based on EURO-CORDEX RCP 8.5 climate scenarios with recent advances in European flood hazard mapping. Further novelties include a threshold-based evaluation of extreme event magnitude and frequency, an alternative method to removing bias in climate projections, the latest pan-European exposure maps, and an improved flood vulnerability estimation. Estimates of population affected and direct flood damages indicate that by the end of the century the socio-economic impact of river floods in Europe is projected to increase by an average 220\\% due to climate change only. When coherent socio-economic development pathways are included in the assessment, central estimates of population annually affected by floods range between 500,000 and 640,000 in 2050, and between 540,000 and 950,000 in 2080, as compared to 216,000 in the current climate. A larger range is foreseen in the annual flood damage, currently of 5.3 B\u20AC, which is projected to rise at 20\u201340 B\u20AC in 2050 and 30\u2013100 B\u20AC in 2080, depending on the future economic growth.",

Ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect, global climate changes, and global warming are among rising environmental concerns. During a recent climate change conference, i.e., COP 26 in Glasgow, UK, in November 2021, the Glasgow climate pact was unveiled to drive action across the globe on mitigation- reducing emissions; adaptation -- helping those already affected by climate change, finance -- enabling countries to deliver on their climate goals and collaboration- working together to deliver even more significant action. Libraries have not been left behind and are engaging in green initiatives to lessen global warming and safeguard the environment through the green library initiative (Singh & Mishra, 2019). Librarians are slowly becoming eco-conscious and developing the sense of creating libraries that minimize power consumption and become energy efficient and environmentally friendly to attain sustainable libraries or green libraries. There is limited research on green initiatives in libraries in Africa, although a lot is being done in some libraries to ensure environmental sustainability. A case study of academic libraries in Kenya was done to establish the perspectives of librarians on going green and levels of adoption while also exploring the motivations and barriers to environmental sustainability championed by libraries. Through purposive sampling, the study looked at ten academic libraries in Kenya that are perceived to be either partially or fully green. Head librarians of these institutions were taken through interviews to explore the adoption of green initiatives. Observation and document review were also used in the mixed methods case study.",

Here, we summarise the epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect various health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that recent global warming has already affected some health outcomes. We review the published estimates of future health effects of climate change over coming decades. Research so far has mostly focused on thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, with some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger prevalence. An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of health risks due to the social, demographic, and economic disruptions of climate change. Evidence and anticipation of adverse health effects will strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and will also guide priorities for planned adaptive strategies.",

To address the urgent need for increased understanding of responses in multifacto-\r\nrial experiments, this article synthesizes how ecosystem productivity and soil processes respond to combined warm-\r\ning and CO2 manipulation, and compares it with those obtained in single factor CO2 and temperature\r\nmanipulation experiments. Across all combined elevated CO2 and warming experiments, biomass production and\r\nsoil respiration were typically enhanced. Responses to the combined treatment were more similar to those in the\r\nCO2-only treatment than to those in the warming-only treatment. In contrast to warming-only experiments, both\r\nthe combined and the CO2-only treatments elicited larger stimulation of fine root biomass than of aboveground bio-\r\nmass, consistently stimulated soil respiration, and decreased foliar nitrogen (N) concentration. Nonetheless, mineral\r\nN availability declined less in the combined treatment than in the CO2-only treatment, possibly due to the warm-\r\ning-induced acceleration of decomposition, implying that progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) may not occur as\r\ncommonly as anticipated from single factor CO2 treatment studies. Responses of total plant biomass, especially of\r\naboveground biomass, revealed antagonistic interactions between elevated CO2 and warming, i.e. the response to\r\nthe combined treatment was usually less-than-additive. This implies that productivity projections might be overesti-\r\nmated when models are parameterized based on single factor responses. Our results highlight the need for more\r\n(and especially more long-term) multifactor manipulation experiments. Because single factor CO2 responses often dominated over warming responses in the combined treatments, our results also suggest that projected responses\r\nto future global warming in Earth System models should not be parameterized using single factor warming\r\nexperiments.",

The 1.5 °C limit constitutes an ambitious goal for which greater evidence on its benefits for health would help guide policy and potentially increase the motivation for action. Here we contribute to this gap with an assessment on the potential health benefits, in terms of reductions in temperature-related mortality, derived from the compliance to the agreed temperature targets, compared to more extreme warming scenarios. We performed a multi-region analysis in 451 locations in 23 countries with different climate zones, and evaluated changes in heat and cold-related mortality under scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets (1.5 and 2 °C) and more extreme GMT increases (3 and 4 °C), and under the assumption of no changes in demographic distribution and vulnerability. Our results suggest that limiting warming below 2 °C could prevent large increases in temperature-related mortality in most regions worldwide. The comparison between 1.5 and 2 °C is more complex and characterized by higher uncertainty, with geographical differences that indicate potential benefits limited to areas located in warmer climates, where direct climate change impacts will be more discernible.",

Here we analyse observations of monthlyP (1940\u20132009) over the global land surface using a new theoretical framework that can distinguish changes in global Pvariance between space and time. We report a near-zero temporal trend in global meanP. Unexpectedly we found a reduction in global land P variance over space and time that was due to a redistribution, where, on average, the dry became wetter while wet became drier. Changes in the P variance were not related to variations in temperature. Instead, the largest changes in P variance were generally found in regions having the largest aerosol emissions. Our results combined with recent modelling studies lead us to speculate that aerosol loading has played a key role in changing the variability of P.",

         "abstract": "This book collects the findings of a group of scientists and economists who have taken stock of climate change impacts on food and agriculture at global and regional levels over the past two decades. The evidence presented describes how global warming will impact where and how food is produced and discusses the significant consequences for food security, health and nutrition, water scarcity and climate adaptation. The book also highlights the implications for global food trade.\n\nThe evidence presented in the book is presented in a way that is widely accessible to policy decision makers and practitioners and makes a distinct contribution towards a greater science-policy interchange. Put together, the different analyses in the book paint a comprehensive perspective linking climate change to food, nutrition, water, and trade along with suggested policy responses.",

Such conditions are accompanied by changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, affecting global climate, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, fisheries and human activities. The alternation of warm El Niño and cold La Niña conditions, referred to as the El Niño\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), represents the strongest year-to-year fluctuation of the global climate system. Here we provide a synopsis of our current understanding of the spatio-temporal complexity of this important climate mode and its influence on the Earth system.",

A key goal is to determine what can be skillfully predicted about the coming year when combining these two ensembles together. Annual surface temperature predictions show good skill at both global and regional scales, but skill diminishes when the trend associated with global warming is removed. Skill for the extended boreal summer (months 7-11) and winter (months 12-16) seasons are examined, focusing on circulation and rainfall predictions. Skill in predicting rainfall in tropical monsoon regions is found to be significant for the majority of regions examined. Skill increases for all regions when active ENSO seasons are forecast. There is some regional skill for predicting extratropical circulation, but predictive signals appear to be spuriously weak.",

The robustness of the oceanic impact is confirmed through the diagnosis of 80 separate 50-yr climate simulations across a suite of atmospheric general circulation models. Drying over the Sahel during boreal summer is shown to be a response to warming of the South Atlantic relative to North Atlantic SST, with the ensuing anomalous interhemispheric SST contrast favoring a more southern position of the Atlantic intertropical convergence zone. Southern African drying during austral summer is shown to be a response to Indian Ocean warming, with enhanced atmospheric convection over those warm waters driving subsidence drying over Africa. The ensemble of greenhouse-gas-forced experiments, conducted as part of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, fails to simulate the pattern or amplitude of the twentieth-century African drying, indicating that the drought conditions were likely of natural origin. For the period 2000?49, the ensemble mean of the forced experiments yields a wet signal over the Sahel and a dry signal over southern Africa. These rainfall changes are physically consistent with a projected warming of the North Atlantic Ocean compared with the South Atlantic Ocean, and a further warming of the Indian Ocean. However, considerable spread exists among the individual members of the multimodel ensemble.",

To assess the uncertainties in these results associated with model parameterization, the Lund-Potsdam-Jena-DGVM (LPJ-DGVM) is analyzed in terms of model robustness and key sensitive parameters. Present-day global land-atmosphere carbon fluxes are relatively well constrained, despite considerable uncertainty in global net primary production mainly propagating from uncertainty in parameters controlling assimilation rate, plant respiration and plant water balance. In response to climate change, water-use efficiency driven increases in net carbon assimilation by plants, transient changes in vegetation composition and global warming effects on soil organic matter dynamics are robust model results. As a consequence, long-term trends in land-atmosphere fluxes are consistently modeled despite an uncertainty range of −3.35 ± 1.45 PgC yr−1 at the end of the twenty-first century for the specific scenario used.",

The 70% of air pollution is due to emissions from an internal combustion engine. Catalytic monolith converters have been used for nearly four decades to reduce the toxicity of exhaust gases from the internal combustion engine powering automotive/machines The harmful gases like NOX, CO, unburned HC and particulate matter increases the global warming, so catalytic converter plays an vital role in reducing harmful gases, but the presence of catalytic converter increases the exhaust back pressure due to this the volumetric efficiency will decrease and fuel consumption is higher. So analysis of catalytic converter is very important. The scarcity and high demand of present catalyst materials necessitate the need for finding out the alternatives.

Wind farms are represented as elevated momentum sinks as well as enhanced turbulence to represent turbine blade mixing in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), a global climate model. For a total installed capacity of 2.5 TW, to provide 16\\% of the world?s projected electricity demand in 2050, minimal impacts are found both regionally and globally on temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes, cloud, and precipitation. A mean near-surface warming of 0.12 ± 0.07 K is seen within the wind farms, with a global-mean temperature change of ?0.013 ± 0.015 K. Impacts on wind speed and turbulence are more pronounced but largely confined within the wind farm areas. Increasing the wind farm areas to provide an installed capacity of 10 TW, or 65\\% of the 2050 electricity demand, causes further impacts; however, they remain slight overall. Maximum temperature changes are less than 0.5 K in the wind farm areas. To provide 20 TW of installed capacity, or 130\\% of the 2050 electricity demand, impacts both within the wind farms and beyond become more pronounced, with a doubling in turbine density. However, maximum temperature changes remain less than 0.7 K. Representing wind farms instead as an increase in surface roughness generally produces similar mean results; however, maximum changes increase, and influences on wind and turbulence are exaggerated. Overall, wind farm impacts are much weaker than those expected from greenhouse gas emissions, with very slight global-mean climate impacts.",

It has been suggested that global warming could enhance freshwater discharge into the North Atlantic and shut down the AMO, causing significant cooling. These possible climate effects have attracted a lot of attention, but little thought has been given to what might happen to the marine ecosystem if the AMO were to weaken or disappear. Andreas Schmittner has performed a detailed simulation and finds that a collapse of the AMO would cut global productivity by about 20%. The model results are consistent with the available records of past productivity. The decline in plankton stocks that would accompany changes of that scale could have a dramatic impact on fisheries in the affected areas.",

Initially, the methods of scenario construction are described. These involve the scaling of the regional patterns of equilibrium climate change produced by general circulation models (GCMs) by the time-dependent projection of global-mean temperature change. A 'Business-as-Usual' forcing scenario is then used to project global warming to the year 2050. This projection is used to develop scenarios of the UK temperature and precipitation change. The implications for sea level are also discussed. Finally, the climate change 'commitment' for the UK, due to past radiative forcing changes and the lags in the climate system, is considered.",

Here, we study the spatial and temporal dynamics of these two processes under scenarios of climate change and evaluate their influence on the carbon balance of the permafrost zone. We use the dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL, which simulates plant physiological and ecological processes and includes a newly developed discrete layer energy balance permafrost module and a vertical carbon distribution within the soil layer. The model is able to reproduce the interactions between vegetation and soil carbon dynamics as well as to simulate dynamic permafrost changes resulting from changes in the climate. We find that vegetation responds more rapidly to warming of the permafrost zone than soil carbon pools due to long time lags in permafrost thawing, and that the initial simulated net uptake of carbon may continue for some decades of warming. However, once the turning point is reached, if carbon release exceeds uptake, carbon is lost irreversibly from the system and cannot be compensated for by increasing vegetation carbon input. Our analysis highlights the importance of including dynamic vegetation and long-term responses into analyses of permafrost zone carbon budgets.",

In particular, climate change wind fields corresponding to the present (control) time-slice 1961\u20132000 and the future (scenario) time-slice 2061\u20132100 are used to drive a wave generation model to produce equivalent control and scenario wave climate. Yearly and seasonal statistics of the scenario wave climates are compared individually to the corresponding control wave climate to identify relative changes of statistical significance between present and future extreme and prevailing wave heights. Using global, regional and linked global\u2013regional wind forcing over a set of nested computational domains, this paper further demonstrates the sensitivity of the results to the resolution and coverage of the forcing. It suggests that the use of combined forcing from linked global and regional climate models of typical resolution and coverage is a good option for the investigation of relative wave changes in the region of interest of this study. Coarse resolution global forcing alone leads to very similar results over regions that are highly exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, fine resolution regional forcing alone is shown to be insufficient for exploring wave climate changes over the western European waters because of its limited coverage. Results obtained with the combined global\u2013regional wind forcing showed some consistency between scenarios. In general, it was shown that mean and extreme wave heights will increase in the future only in winter and only in the southwest of UK and west of France, north of about 44\u201345° N. Otherwise, wave heights are projected to decrease, especially in summer. Nevertheless, this decrease is dominated by local wind waves whilst swell is found to increase. Only in spring do both swell and local wind waves decrease in average height.",

Regional temperature changes are often greater or smaller than corresponding changes in the global mean. In some cases the direction of change may also be different. For example, temperature changes are higher over land than over the ocean. Precipitation increases in some regions but decreases in others. Changes in extreme events may differ from changes in the corresponding mean. Present scientific knowledge clearly indicates that the already observed global trend towards warmer conditions will continue and that it will be accompanied by changes in yet other aspects of climate. This paper highlights, as a brief review, aspects of our changing climate from the available scientific knowledge with a bearing on the energy sector. Its focus is on temperature and precipitation, with some consideration of wind and sea level, among others. While uncertainties remain as far as the magnitude of future global-scale changes is concerned, and even more so their many regional patterns, significant changes are foreseen in, for example, global and regional temperature and precipitation, sea level rise, and in the characteristics of various extreme events.",

Instead, we consider the key question 'when will specific temperature thresholds be exceeded?' Framing the question as 'when might something happen (either permanently or temporarily)?' rather than 'what might happen?' demonstrates that lowering future emissions will delay the crossing of temperature thresholds and buy valuable time for planning adaptation. For example, in higher greenhouse-gas emission scenarios, a global average 2 °C warming threshold is likely to be crossed by 2060, whereas in a lower emissions scenario, the crossing of this threshold is delayed by up to several decades. On regional scales, however, the 2 °C threshold will probably be exceeded over large parts of Eurasia, North Africa and Canada by 2040 if emissions continue to increase \u2014 well within the lifetime of many people living now.",

We provide a comprehensive analysis of radiative forcing from the road transport, shipping, aviation, and rail subsectors, using both past- and forward-looking perspectives. We find that, since preindustrial times, transport has contributed ≈15\\% and 31\\% of the total man-made CO2 and O3 forcing, respectively. A forward-looking perspective shows that the current emissions from transport are responsible for ≈16\\% of the integrated net forcing over 100 years from all current man-made emissions. The dominating contributor to positive forcing (warming) is CO2, followed by tropospheric O3. By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to warming. The transport sector also exerts cooling through reduced methane lifetime and atmospheric aerosol effects. Shipping causes net cooling, except on future time scales of several centuries. Much of the forcing from transport comes from emissions not covered by the Kyoto Protocol.",

The annual global CO2 flux from soils is estimated to average 68 +/- 4 PgC/yr, based on extrapolations from biome land areas. On a global scale, soil-respiration rates are positively correlated with mean annual air temperatures and mean annual precipitation. There is a chosen correlation between mean annual net primary productivity of different vegetation biomes and their mean annual soil respiration rates. Estimates of soil C turnover rates range from 500 years in tundra and peaty wetlands to 10 years in tropical savannas. The impacts of human activities on soil-respiration rates are poorly documented, and vary among sites. Of particular importance are potential changes in temperatures and precipitation. Based on a review of in situ measurements, the Q10 value for total soil respiration has a median value of 2.4. Increased soil respiration with global warming is likely to provide a positive feedback to the greenhouse effect.",

         "abstract": "Due to a number of recent high profile flood events and the apparent threat from global warming, governments and their agencies are under pressure to make proactive investments to protect people living in floodplains. However, adopting a proactive approach as a universal strategy is not affordable. It has been argued that delaying expensive and essentially irreversible capital decisions could be a prudent strategy in situations with high future uncertainty. This paper firstly uses Monte Carlo simulation to explore the performance of proactive and reactive investment strategies using a rational cost-benefit approach in a natural system with varying levels of persistence/interannual variability in Annual Maximum Floods. It is found that, as persistence increases, there is a change in investment strategy optimality from proactive to reactive. This could have implications for investment strategies under the increasingly variable climate that is expected with global warming.\r\n\r\nAs part of the emerging holistic approaches to flood risk management, there is increasing emphasis on stakeholder participation in determining where and when flood protection investments are made, and so flood risk management is becoming more people-centred. As a consequence, multiple actors are involved in the decision-making process, and the social sciences are assuming an increasingly important role in flood risk management. There is a need for modelling approaches which can couple the natural and human system elements. It is proposed that Coupled Human and Natural System (CHANS) modelling could play an important role in understanding the motivations, actions and influence of citizens and institutions and how these impact on the effective delivery of flood protection investment. A framework for using Agent Based Modelling of human activities leading to flood investments is outlined, and some of the challenges associated with implementation are discussed.",

Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) fumigating depleted 13CO2 in rice paddy resulted in a smaller 13C/12C ratio in plant-assimilated carbon, providing a unique measure by which we partitioned the sources of decomposed gases (CO2 and CH4) into current-season photosynthates (new C) and soil organic matter (old C). In addition, we imposed a soil-warming treatment nested within the CO2 treatments to assess whether the carbon source was sensitive to warming. Compared with the ambient CO2 treatment, the FACE treatment decreased the 13C/12C ratio not only in the rice-plant carbon but also in the soil CO2 and CH4. The estimated new C contribution to dissolved CO2 was minor (ca. 20\\%) at the tillering stage, increased with rice growth and was about 50\\% from the panicle-formation stage onwards. For CH4, the contribution of new C was greater than for heterotrophic CO2 production; ca. 40\u201360\\% of season-total CH4 production originated from new C with a tendency toward even larger new C contribution with soil warming, presumably because enhanced root decay provided substrates for greater CH4 production. The results suggest a fast and close coupling between photosynthesis and anoxic decomposition in soil, and further indicate a positive feedback of global warming by enhanced CH4 emission through greater rhizodeposition.",

It also puts forward various suggestions and methods for greening existing libraries and also discuss the need and importance of implementing green library concepts. Introduction Our beautiful nature is continuously degraded by human beings and causing problems like global warming and climate change. Shrinking glaciors, melting ice caps and wide ranges in temperature provide evidence that something is happening with our climate. Libraries don't come into our mind when we think of problems like global warming and climate change. But Libraries consume a lot of energy for its services and hence contribute to the problem. A healthy natural environment is needed for our survival and quality of life. So it's high time for us librarians to play a major role for the betterment of environment. We can design a green library by means of choosing appropriate site for constructing library building, use of natural material and biodegradable products for construction, conservation of resources i.e., water, energy, paper etc. and responsible for recycling of waste materials. So the concepts of green libraries are now being popular and through proper designing of green library we can reduce the harmful impact on the environment and it also improve the environment inside the library.",

Along with a possible increased hazard of tropical cyclones due to global warming, there is an inescapable increase in vulnerability and disaster risk towards tropical cyclones due to population growth and coastal infrastructure developments. In Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula has the highest landfall rates of major category hurricanes in addition to the highest rate of population growth in major tourist cities. Therefore, the assessment of landfalling tropical cyclones is of paramount importance for emergency management and planning. This paper provides an assessment of the future climate for landfalling tropical cyclones in the Yucatan Peninsula, based on synthetic tropical cyclones driven by atmospheric models (reanalysis and six different general circulation models (GCMs)) and under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate change scenario. The results using the ensemble mean from the GCMs show that the Yucatan Peninsula will be more susceptible to more frequent intense hurricanes and more regular events undergoing rapid intensification. We conclude that even under the uncertainty imposed by the results, it is more likely than not that the future climate will bring more extreme events to this area. Therefore, it becomes imperative to implement strategic planning based on the characterization of tropical cyclone hazards framed within the assessment of global warming effects. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",

The projected yields of crops under a range of agricultural and climatic scenarios are needed to assess food security prospects. Previous meta-analyses3 have summarized climate change impacts and adaptive potential as a function of temperature, but have not examined uncertainty, the timing of impacts, or the quantitative effectiveness of adaptation. Here we develop a new data set of more than 1,700 published simulations to evaluate yield impacts of climate change and adaptation. Without adaptation, losses in aggregate production are expected for wheat, rice and maize in both temperate and tropical regions by 2 °C of local warming. Crop-level adaptations increase simulated yields by an average of 7\u201315\\%, with adaptations more effective for wheat and rice than maize. Yield losses are greater in magnitude for the second half of the century than for the first. Consensus on yield decreases in the second half of the century is stronger in tropical than temperate regions, yet even moderate warming may reduce temperate crop yields in many locations. Although less is known about interannual variability than mean yields, the available data indicate that increases in yield variability are likely.",

The magnitude of the vegetation changes and their spatial distribution are based on natural decadal variability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Different scenarios using maximum and minimum vegetation cover were derived from satellite records spanning the period 1982?90. Albedo decreased in the northern latitudes and increased in the Tropics with increased NDVI. The increase in vegetation density revealed that the vegetation?s physiological response was constrained by the limits of the available water resources. The difference between the maximum and minimum vegetation scenarios resulted in a 46\\% increase in absorbed visible solar radiation and a similar increase in gross photosynthetic CO2 uptake on a global annual basis. This increase caused the canopy transpiration and interception fluxes to increase and reduced those from the soil. The redistribution of the surface energy fluxes substantially reduced the Bowen ratio during the growing season, resulting in cooler and moister near-surface climate, except when soil moisture was limiting. Important effects of increased vegetation on climate are a cooling of about 1.8 K in the northern latitudes during the growing season and a slight warming during the winter, which is primarily due to the masking of high albedo of snow by a denser canopy; and a year-round cooling of 0.8 K in the Tropics. These results suggest that increases in vegetation density could partially compensate for parallel increases in greenhouse warming. Increasing vegetation density globally caused both evapotranspiration and precipitation to increase. Evapotranspiration, however, increased more than precipitation, resulting in a global soil-water deficit of about 15\\%. A spectral analysis on the simulated results showed that changes in the state of vegetation could affect the low-frequency modes of the precipitation distribution and might reduce its low-frequency variability in the Tropics while increasing it in northern latitudes.",

Each decadal prediction consists of simulations over a 10 year period each of which are initialized every five years from climate states of 1960/1961 to 2005/2006. Most of the models overestimate trends, whereby the models predict less warming or even cooling in the earlier decades compared to observations and too much warming in recent decades. All models show high prediction skill for surface temperature over the Indian, North Atlantic and western Pacific Oceans where the externally forced component and low-frequency climate variability is dominant. However, low prediction skill is found over the equatorial and North Pacific Ocean. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index is predicted in most of the models with significant skill, while the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index shows relatively low predictive skill. The multi-model ensemble has in general better-forecast quality than the single-model systems for global mean surface temperature, AMO and PDO.",

In addition to the projected changes during the twenty-first century, extended simulations to the year 2300 allow an investigation into inertia in the climate system post-2100 that may occur even if atmospheric CO2 concentrations have stabilized. Projections of temperature, precipitation, sea level, permafrost, heat waves, and compatible carbon emissions are analyzed. The low emissions scenario RCP2.6 is the only scenario considered here that is approximately consistent with a 2°C global warming limit, though there are regions where local changes in temperature are projected to considerably exceed 2°C, particularly over northern high-latitude areas. An aggressive mitigation approach, represented here by RCP2.6, could contribute to avoiding the larger-magnitude future climate changes projected under higher emissions scenarios. Despite these benefits, changes should still be expected under an aggressive mitigation pathway and may require adaptation.",

         "volume": "23","pages": "--","abstract": "We evaluated how climate change, rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, and land use change influenced the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle for the last century using a process-based ecosystem model. Over the last century, the modeled land use change emitted about 129 Pg of C to the atmosphere. About 76% (or 98 Pg C) of this emission, however, was offset by net C uptake on land driven by climate changes and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. Thus, the modeled net release of C from the terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere from 1901 to 2002 is about 31 Pg C. Global net primary productivity (NPP) has significantly increased by 14% during the last century, especially since the 1970s. From 1980 to 2002, global NPP increased with an average increase rate of 0.4% yr−1. At global scale, such an increase seems to be primarily attributed to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and then to precipitation change. Over the last 2 decades, climate change and rising CO2 forced the land carbon sink (1.6 Pg C yr−1 for 1980s and 2.2 Pg C yr−1 for 1990s) to be larger than land use change driven carbon emissions (1.0 Pg C yr−1 for 1980s and 1.2 Pg C yr−1 for 1990s), resulting a net land sink of 0.5 Pg C yr−1 in the 1980s and of 1.0 Pg C yr−1 in the 1990s. The largest C emission from land use change appeared in tropical regions with an average emission of 0.6 Pg C yr−1 in 1980s and 0.7 Pg C yr−1 in 1990s, which is slightly larger than net carbon uptake due to CO2 fertilization and climate change. Thus, net carbon balance of tropical lands is close to neutral over the past 2 decades (about 0.13 Pg C yr−1 in 1980s and 0.03 Pg C yr−1 in 1990s). We also found that current global warming has already started accelerating C loss from terrestrial ecosystems, by enhanced decomposition of soil organic carbon. In response to warming trends only, the global net carbon uptake significantly decreased, offsetting about 70% of the increase in global net carbon uptake owing to CO2 fertilization during 1980\u20132002. The global terrestrial C cycle also shows large year-to-year variations, and different regions have quite distinct dominant drivers. Generally, interannual changes of carbon fluxes in tropical and temperate ecosystems are mainly explained by precipitation variability, while temperature variability plays a major role in boreal ecosystems.",

Both the direct scattering of short-wavelength solar radiation and the modification of the shortwave reflective properties of clouds by sulfate aerosol particles increase planetary albedo, thereby exerting a cooling influence on the planet. Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be - 1 to - 2 watts per square meter, globally averaged. This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign. Thus, the aerosol forcing has likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree. However, differences in geographical and seasonal distributions of these forcings preclude any simple compensation. Aerosol effects must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influences on past, current, and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding controls on emission of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide. Resolution of such policy issues requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical processes.",

As the Earth's climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita interaction strength and the relative abundance of interacting species. Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can drive important local-scale changes in community dynamics, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In many cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming, mediated by changing species interactions, will be greater\u2014albeit less well understood\u2014than direct effects in determining the community- and ecosystem-level outcomes of global climate change. Despite considerable community-specific idiosyncrasy, ecological theory and a growing body of data suggest that certain general trends are emerging at local scales: positive interactions tend to become more prevalent with warming, and top trophic levels are disproportionately vulnerable. In addition, important ecological changes result when the geographic overlap between species changes, and when the seasonal timing of life history events of interacting species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the degree to which such changes are predictable, and urge advancement on several high priority questions surrounding the relationships between temperature and community ecology. An improved understanding of how assemblages of multiple, interacting species will respond to climate change is imperative if we hope to effectively prepare for and adapt to its effects.",

Warming climate and human expansion in fire\u2010prone landscapes exacerbate fire impacts and call for more effective management tools. Here we developed a global fire forecasting system that predicts monthly emissions using past fire data and climate variables for lead times of 1 to 6 months. Using monthly fire emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) as the prediction target, we fit a statistical time series model, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with eXogenous variables (ARIMAX), in over 1,300 different fire regions. Optimized parameters were then used to forecast future emissions. The forecast system took into account information about region\u2010specific seasonality, long\u2010term trends, recent fire observations, and climate drivers representing both large\u2010scale climate variability and local fire weather. We cross\u2010validated the forecast skill of the system with different combinations of predictors and forecast lead times. The reference model, which combined endogenous and exogenous predictors with a 1 month forecast lead time, explained 52% of the variability in the global fire emissions anomaly, considerably exceeding the performance of a reference model that assumed persistent emissions during the forecast period. The system also successfully resolved detailed spatial patterns of fire emissions anomalies in regions with significant fire activity. This study bridges the gap between the efforts of near\u2010real\u2010time fire forecasts and seasonal fire outlooks and represents a step toward establishing an operational global fire, smoke, and carbon cycle forecasting system.",

The location and relative magnitude of freshwater forcing due to drifting icebergs is calculated from a separate iceberg drift simulation. We assume fixed annual spatial patterns with magnitudes varying in time. These magnitudes are based on a severe warming scenario based on expert elicitation. The resultant freshwater forcing is applied to a global climate model and the effects on sea-level rise are discussed. The simulations show strong sea level rise on the Antarctic continental shelves.

For the period when the statistical forecast system changed little, 2000\u20132010, issued forecasts had a high correlation of 0.74 with observations and a root mean square error of 0.07°C. However, the HadCRUT data sets against which issued forecasts were verified were biased slightly cold, especially from 2004, because of data gaps in the strongly warming Arctic. This observational cold bias was mainly responsible for a statistically significant warm bias in the 2000\u20132010 forecasts of 0.06°C. Climate forcing data sets used in the statistical method, and verification data, have recently been modified, increasing hindcast correlation skill to 0.80 with no significant bias. Dynamical hindcasts for 2000\u20132011 have a similar correlation skill of 0.78 and skillfully hindcast annual mean spatial global surface temperature patterns.

We develop metrics to compare the drought risk calculated under the assumptions of stationarity and nonstationarity and identify their spatial and temporal patterns. By analyzing the variability of drought risk in the past and exploring its ongoing patterns, we evaluate in which regions of the contiguous United States the assumption of stationarity can be safely used for drought risk planning and management. We find statistically significant interdecadal changes in the probability distribution functions of drought severity in parts of the Northwest, upper Midwest, the Northeast, eastern parts of Great Plains and in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada in the Southwest. In these regions, the nonstationary risk has been significantly higher than the stationary estimate of risk in the past, which shows that the assumption of stationarity can lead to the underestimation of drought risk in these regions. The multidecadal drought risk shows low variability in California, parts of northern and western Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and in the Southeast, since the statistical properties of droughts have not changed significantly in these regions during 1901\u20132017. However, the meteorological drought risk has increased in California and the Southeast in the recent decades due to the influence of global warming and hence the assumption of stationarity for risk estimation may lead to underestimation of drought risk in future in these regions if this effect of global warming persists.",

To test this hypothesis, we study the response of the atmosphere to Arctic amplification for a projected summer sea-ice-free period using an atmospheric model with prescribed surface boundary conditions from a state-of-the-art Earth system model. Besides a standard global warming simulation, we also conducted a sensitivity experiment with sea ice and sea surface temperature anomalies in the Arctic. We show that when global climate warms, enhancement of the northward heat transport provides the major contribution to decrease the northward temperature gradient in the polar troposphere in cold seasons, causing more oscillation of the planetary waves. However, while Arctic amplification significantly enhances near-surface air temperature in the polar region, it is not large enough to invoke an increased oscillation of the planetary waves.",

However, it cannot be ruled out that the 1.5°C target passes a cost-benefit test. Costs are almost certainly high: The median global carbon price in 1.5°C scenarios implemented by various energy models is more than US\\$100 per metric ton of CO2 in 2020, for example. Benefits estimates range from much lower than this to much higher. Some of these uncertainties may reduce in the future, raising the question of how to hedge in the near term. Maintaining an option on limiting warming to 1.5°C means targeting it now. Setting off with higher emissions will make 1.5°C unattainable quickly without recourse to expensive large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR), or solar radiation management (SRM), which can be cheap but poses ambiguous risks society seems unwilling to take. Carbon pricing could reduce mitigation costs substantially compared with ramping up the current patchwork of regulatory instruments. Nonetheless, a mix of policies is justified and technology-specific approaches may be required. It is particularly important to step up mitigation finance to developing countries, where emissions abatement is relatively cheap.",

Climate change adaptation and ozone regulation have been identified as important strategies to safeguard food production5, 6, but little is known about how climate and ozone pollution interact to affect agriculture, nor the relative effectiveness of these two strategies for different crops and regions. Here we present an integrated analysis of the individual and combined effects of 2000\u20132050 climate change and ozone trends on the production of four major crops (wheat, rice, maize and soybean) worldwide based on historical observations and model projections, specifically accounting for ozone\u2013temperature co-variation. The projections exclude the effect of rising CO2, which has complex and potentially offsetting impacts on global food supply7, 8, 9, 10. We show that warming reduces global crop production by >10\\% by 2050 with a potential to substantially worsen global malnutrition in all scenarios considered. Ozone trends either exacerbate or offset a substantial fraction of climate impacts depending on the scenario, suggesting the importance of air quality management in agricultural planning. Furthermore, we find that depending on region some crops are primarily sensitive to either ozone (for example, wheat) or heat (for example, maize) alone, providing a measure of relative benefits of climate adaptation versus ozone regulation for food security in different regions.",

The extreme value models are applied to estimate 20-yr return values of maximum daily temperature over Europe in transient global climate model (GCM) simulations for the 21st century. A comparison of scenarios of changes in the 20-yr return temperatures based on the non-stationary peaks-over-threshold models with conventional stationary models is performed. It is demonstrated that the application of the stationary extreme value models in temperature data from GCM scenarios yields results that may be to a large extent biased, while the non-stationary models lead to spatial patterns that are robust and enable one to detect areas where the projected warming in the tail of the distribution of daily temperatures is largest. The method also allows splitting the projected warming of extremely high quantiles into two parts that reflect change in the location and scale of the distribution of extremes, respectively. Spatial patterns of the two components differ significantly in the examined climate change projections over Europe.",

Although maize is the most highly produced crop worldwide, few studies have evaluated the interactive effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on its photosynthetic physiology, agronomic traits or biomass, and seed yield under open field conditions. This study investigates the effects of rising CO2 and warmer temperature, independently and in combination, on maize grown in the field throughout a full growing season. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology was used to target atmospheric CO2 to 200 mu mol mol similar to 1 above ambient CO2 and infrared heaters to target a plant canopy increase of 3.5 degrees C, with actual season mean heating of similar to 2.7 degrees C, mimicking conditions predicted by the second half of this century. Photosynthetic gas-exchange parameters, leaf nitrogen and carbon content, leaf water potential components, and developmental measurements were collected throughout the season, and biomass and yield were measured at the end of the growing season. As predicted for a C-4 plant, elevated CO2 did not stimulate photosynthesis, biomass, or yield. Canopy warming caused a large shift in aboveground allocation by stimulating season-long vegetative biomass and decreasing reproductive biomass accumulation at both CO2 concentrations, resulting in decreased harvest index. Warming caused a reduction in photosynthesis due to down-regulation of photosynthetic biochemical parameters and the decrease in the electron transport rate. The reduction in seed yield with warming was driven by reduced photosynthetic capacity and by a shift in aboveground carbon allocation away from reproduction. This field study portends that future warming will reduce yield in maize, and this will not be mitigated by higher atmospheric CO2 unless appropriate adaptation traits can be introduced into future cultivars.",

Since the early 2000s, ocean sensors have started to monitor the AMOC, but the measurements are still far from accurate and the time window does not permit the separation of short term variability from a longer term trend. Other works have claimed that global warming is slowing down the AMOC, based on models and proxies of temperatures. Some other observations demonstrate a stable circulation of the oceans. By using tide gauge data complementing recent satellite and ocean sensor observations, the stability of the AMOC is shown to go back to 1860. It is concluded that no available information has the due accuracy and time coverage to show a clear trend outside the inter-annual and multi-decadal variability in the direction of increasing or decreasing strength over the last decades.",

         "abstract": "\"It is worse, much worse, than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, \"500-year\" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually. This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century. In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await--food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today. Like An Inconvenient Truth and Silent Spring before it, The Uninhabitable Earth is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action. For just as the world was brought to the brink of catastrophe within the span of a lifetime, the responsibility to avoid it now belongs to a single generation\"--",

The study assumes early actions and quantifies the market penetration of low carbon technologies, the emission pathways and the economic costs for an efficient reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such that the temperature limit is not exceeded. We evaluate the potential role of direct air capture (DAC) and its impact on policy costs and energy consumption. DAC is a technology that removes emissions directly from the atmosphere contributing to negative carbon emissions. We find that, with our modelling assumptions, limiting global temperature to 1.5 °C is only possible when using DAC. Our results show that the DAC technology can play an important role in realising deep decarbonisation goals and in the reduction of regional and global mitigation costs with stringent targets. DAC acts a substitute to Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the stringent scenarios. For this analysis, we use the model MERGE-ETL, a technology-rich integrated assessment model with endogenous learning.",

Specifically, the FGOALS-s2 was integrated with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to conduct coordinated experiments that will provide valuable scientific information to climate research communities. The performances of FGOALS-s2 were assessed in simulating major climate phenomena, and documented both the strengths and weaknesses of the model. The results indicate that FGOALS-s2 successfully overcomes climate drift, and realistically models global and regional climate characteristics, including SST, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation. In particular, the model accurately captures annual and semi-annual SST cycles in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the main characteristic features of the Asian summer monsoon, which include a low-level southwestern jet and five monsoon rainfall centers. The simulated climate variability was further examined in terms of teleconnections, leading modes of global SST (namely, ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO), and changes in 19th\u201320th century climate. The analysis demonstrates that FGOALS-s2 realistically simulates extra-tropical teleconnection patterns of large-scale climate, and irregular ENSO periods. The model gives fairly reasonable reconstructions of spatial patterns of PDO and global monsoon changes in the 20th century. However, because the indirect effects of aerosols are not included in the model, the simulated global temperature change during the period 1850\u20132005 is greater than the observed warming, by 0.6°C. Some other shortcomings of the model are also noted.",

Routine monitoring of airborne pollen, now undertaken on a near-global basis, could be adapted for this purpose. Analysis of spatial and seasonal variations in pollen levels in New Zealand suggests that the timing of onset and peak abundance of certain pollen taxa should be explored as possible bio-indicators of climate change. The onset of the airborne grass pollen season during the summer of 1988/89 varied consistently with latitude, and hence temperature, with the season in Southland commencing 8--9 days after Northland. However, these patterns were only apparent after sampling sites were separated into two groups reflecting predominantly urban or rural pollen sources. A less consistent north to south trend was apparent in the frequency of high (30 grains/m3) grass pollen levels, with high levels frequent in North Island localities in November, December and January and in southern localities during December and January. The successive onset of pollen seasons for the principal tree species during the spring-to-early summer warming interval may also be a useful bio-indicator of climate change. As well as assisting forecasts of the onset of the pollinosis season, these biogeographical patterns, reflecting climatic variation with latitude, suggest that routine aeropalynological monitoring might provide early signals of vegetation response to climate change. These conclusions are supported by recent investigations of long-term aeropalynological datasets in Europe that indicate earlier onset of pollen seasons in response to recent global warming.",

The release of version 3 monthly mean temperature data marks the first major revision to this data set in over ten years. It introduces a number of improvements and changes that include consolidating  \u201D duplicate\u201D series, updating records from recent decades, and the use of new approaches to homogenization and quality assurance. Although the underlying structure of the data set is significantly different than version 2, conclusions regarding the rate of warming in global land surface temperature are largely unchanged.",

By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951\u20132003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901\u20132003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901\u20131950, 1951\u20131978 and 1979\u20132003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century.",

CMIP5 models can simulate the ENSO-monsoon spatial structure reasonably well when using the multi-model mean. Running correlations show prominent decadal variability of the ENSO-monsoon relationship in observations. The modeled ENSO-monsoon relation shows large inter-model spread, indicating large variations across the model ensemble. The anthropogenically forced component of ENSO-monsoon relationship is separated from the naturally varying component based on a signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal function analysis using global sea surface temperature (SST). Results show that natural variability plays a dominant role in the varied ENSO-monsoon relationship during the 20th century. In the 21st century, the forced component is dominated by enhanced monsoon rainfall associated with SST warming, which may contribute to a slightly weakened ENSO-monsoon relation in the future.",

Accordingly, the installed capacity of wind turbines grew at an annualized rate of >20% from 2000 to 2019 and is projected to increase by a further 50% by the end of 2023. In this Review, we describe the factors that dictate the wind resource magnitude and variability and illustrate the tools and techniques that are being used to make projections of wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions. Natural variability due to the action of internal climate modes appears to dominate over global-warming-induced non-stationarity over most areas with large wind energy installations or potential. However, there is evidence for increased wind energy resources by the end of the current century in northern Europe and the US Southern Great Plains. New technology trends are changing the sensitivity of wind energy to global climate non-stationarity and, thus, present new challenges and opportunities for innovative research. The evolution of climate modelling to increasingly address mesoscale processes is providing improved projections of both wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions, and will contribute to continued reductions in the levelized cost of energy from wind power generation.",

Such indicators include the peak year of global emissions, the decarbonisation rate and the deployment of low-carbon technology. Here, we show typical values for these indicators for different carbon budgets, using the recently compiled IPCC scenario database, and discuss how these vary as a function of non-CO2 forcing, energy use and policy delay. For carbon budgets of 2000 GtCO2 and less over the 2010\u20132100 period, supply of low carbon technologies needs to be scaled up massively from today's levels, unless energy use is relatively low. For the subgroup of scenarios with a budget below 1000 GtCO2 (consistent with >66\\% chance of limiting global warming to below 2 °C relative to preindustrial levels), the 2050 contribution of low-carbon technologies is generally around 50\\%\u201375\\%, compared to less than 20\\% today (range refers to the 10\u201390th interval of available data).",

The author, who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, argues that single policies adopted only at a global scale are unlikely to generate sufficient trust among citizens and firms so that collective action can take place in a comprehensive and transparent manner that will effectively reduce global warming. Furthermore, simply recommending a single governmental unit to solve global collective action problems is inherently weak because of free-rider problems. For example, the Carbon Development Mechanism (CDM) can be `gamed' in ways that hike up prices of natural resources and in some cases can lead to further natural resource exploitation. Some flaws are also noticeable in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) program. Both the CDM and REDD are vulnerable to the free-rider problem. As an alternative, the paper proposes a polycentric approach at various levels with active oversight of local, regional, and national stakeholders. Efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions are a classic collective action problem that is best addressed at multiple scales and levels. Given the slowness and conflict involved in achieving a global solution to climate change, recognizing the potential for building a more effective way of reducing green house gas emissions at multiple levels is an important step forward. A polycentric approach has the main advantage of encouraging experimental efforts at multiple levels, leading to the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one type of ecosystem and compared to results obtained in other ecosystems. Building a strong commitment to find ways of reducing individual emissions is an important element for coping with this problem, and having others also take responsibility can be more effectively undertaken in small- to medium-scale governance units that are linked together through information networks and monitoring at all levels. This paper was prepared as a background paper for the 2010 World Development Report on Climate Change.",

However, the halogenated refrigerants have adverse environmental impacts such as ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP). Hence, it is necessary to look for alternative refrigerants to full fill the objectives of the international protocols (Montreal and Kyoto) and to satisfy the growing worldwide demand. This paper reviews the various experimental and theoretical studies carried out around the globe with environment friendly alternatives such as hydrocarbons (HC), hydroflurocarbons (HFC) and their mixtures, which are going to be the promising long-term alternatives. In addition, the technical difficulties of mixed refrigerants and future challenges of the alternatives are discussed. The problems pertaining to the usage of environment friendly refrigerants are also analyzed.",

Fire potential is measured by the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), which is calculated using the observed maximum temperature and precipitation and projected changes at the end of this century (2070-2100) by general circulation models (GCMs) for present and future climate conditions, respectively. It is shown that future wildfire potential increases significantly in the United States, South America, central Asia, southern Europe, southern Africa, and Australia. Fire potential moves up by one level in these regions, from currently low to future moderate potential or from moderate to high potential. Relative changes are the largest and smallest in southern Europe and Australia, respectively. The period with the KBDI greater than 400 (a simple definition for fire season in this study) becomes a few months longer. The increased fire potential is mainly caused by warming in the U.S., South America, and Australia and by the combination of warming and drying in the other regions. Sensitivity analysis shows that future fire potential depends on many factors such as climate model and emission scenario used for climate change projection. The results suggest dramatic increases in wildfire potential that will require increased future resources and management efforts for disaster prevention and recovery.",

Here, we present the analysis of a 30-year run with a global eddy-resolving (1/12°) version of the NEMO ocean model. Compared to the 1° and 1/4° equivalent versions, this simulation more realistically represents the shape of the Subpolar Gyre, the position of the North Atlantic Current, and the Gulf Stream separation. Other key improvements are found in the representation of boundary currents, multi-year variability of temperature and depth of winter mixing in the Labrador Sea, and the transport of overflows at the Greenland\u2013Scotland Ridge. However, the salinity, stratification and mean depth of winter mixing in the Labrador Sea, and the density and depth of overflow water south of the sill, still present challenges to the model. This simulation also provides further insight into the spatio-temporal development of the warming event observed in the Subpolar Gyre in the mid 1990s, which appears to coincide with a phase of increased eddy activity in the southernmost part of the gyre. This may have provided a gateway through which heat would have propagated into the gyre's interior.",

Climate models consistently project the AC to decline in the 21st century. Previous studies typically attributed the weakening of AC to changes in Indian Ocean wind and/or a decline of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) transport. However, our analysis suggests that changes in local surface wind and ITF can only explain a portion of the model-simulated AC changes. Using a hierarchy of models, we show that the decline of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength in a warming climate could also contribute substantially to the AC weakening. Following a weakening of the AMOC, the baroclinic structure of the AC is also modified such that the AC is shoaled to a shallower depth, communicated between basins via Kelvin waves. Our results highlight the importance of remote processes in future western boundary current changes.",

Both are likely related to differences in vessel anatomy, and all may affect responses to climate changes in the Arctic. To investigate the relationships among leaf character, growth form, vessel anatomy, and susceptibility to freeze-thaw-induced xylem cavitation, xylem vessel characteristics were compared among six deciduous and six evergreen arctic dicot species of erect and prostrate growth forms. We hypothesized that deciduous and erect species would have larger and longer vessels than evergreen and cushion/mat-forming species. Vessel lengths, diameters, and densities were measured for each species. Theoretical vessel flow rates were calculated using Poiseuille's law for ideal capillaries. Flow rates were used to determine the susceptibility of vessels to cavitation induced by freeze-thaw events that may become more frequent with global warming. Vessel diameters were larger in deciduous species compared to evergreens, and in shrubs/trees vs. cushion/mat-forming plants. Vessel length distributions, however, did not differ for growth form or leaf character. Vessel density was greater in cushion/mat-forming species than in shrub/tree species. Deciduous plants showed a greater contribution to total conductivity by relatively larger vessels than evergreens. One of the deciduous species, Vaccinium uliginosum, is predicted to be susceptible to freeze-thaw-induced cavitation. These results have important implications for future arctic species composition and plant community structure.",

This may be achieved by alternating crop phonological properties including the vernalization stage, essential for the vegetative/reproductive transition of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Shortening vernalization, during spring, can be a suitable method for the earlier production of crop plants, especially under stress conditions. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that it is possible to shorten vernalization, using priming (seeds) and spraying (plants) treatments while achieving optimum yield, in winter wheat, under the arid and semi arid conditions of Isfahan, Iran. The objective was to investigate the effects of plant growth regulators including gibberellic acid (GA, 100 mg/l), kinetin (100 and 200 mg/l), 6-benzyl adenine (BA6, 50 mg/l) and cold stratification on shortening vernalization in winter wheat. The research was a split plot experiment on the basis of a completely randomized block design, with four replicates, conducted in 2016. Different traits including number of fertile tillers (NFT), number of grains per spike (NGS), weight of 1000 grains (W1000), number of spikelet per spike (NST), grain yield (GY), protein percentage (PRO), and moist gluten percentage (MGP) were determined. The results indicated that priming and spraying winter wheat with the single or combined use of GA, kinetin and BA6 is the most suitable replacement for vernalization and increasing grain yield, under arid and semi arid conditions. However, priming winter wheat with cold stratification was not as effective, compared with the use of plant growth regulators. The highest grain yield (15.13 t/ha) was resulted by autumn planting + B8 (GA + BA6), followed by spring planting + GA and B9 (14.82 t/ha). Spraying wheat planted in spring (without priming and vernalization) with kinetin + GA3+GA7 (100 mg/l), increased PRO and MGP. The important results of this research work are: 1) planting winter wheat as spring wheat (vernalization not required) resulted in optimum yield amounts by priming and spraying techniques using gibberellins, kinetin and 6-benzyl adenine. This is of significance, with respect to the issue of global warming. 2) Shortening vernalization in winter wheat, which is especially important under arid and semi arid conditions, as the plant is subjected to different stresses including drought. 3) Improving wheat grain quality by the increased rate of protein and gluten. It is possible to plant winter wheat under arid and semi arid conditions using gibberellins, kinetin and benzyl adenine. Such a method results in alleviating the adverse effects of global warming on wheat production. It is also possible to plant winter wheat under different stresses including drought and cold by controlling the vernalization process.",

         "number": "5095","abstract": "This paper proposes an alternative approach to addressing the complex problems of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The author, who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, argues that single policies adopted only at a global scale are unlikely to generate sufficient trust among citizens and firms so that collective action can take place in a comprehensive and transparent manner that will effectively reduce global warming. Furthermore, simply recommending a single governmental unit to solve global collective action problems is inherently weak because of free-rider problems. For example, the Carbon Development Mechanism (CDM) can be \u0091gamed\u0092 in ways that hike up prices of natural resources and in some cases can lead to further natural resource exploitation. Some flaws are also noticeable in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) program. Both the CDM and REDD are vulnerable to the free-rider problem. As an alternative, the paper proposes a polycentric approach at various levels with active oversight of local, regional, and national stakeholders. Efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions are a classic collective action problem that is best addressed at multiple scales and levels. Given the slowness and conflict involved in achieving a global solution to climate change, recognizing the potential for building a more effective way of reducing green house gas emissions at multiple levels is an important step forward. A polycentric approach has the main advantage of encouraging experimental efforts at multiple levels, leading to the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one type of ecosystem and compared to results obtained in other ecosystems. Building a strong commitment to find ways of reducing individual emissions is an important element for coping with this problem, and having others also take responsibility can be more effectively undertaken in small- to medium-scale governance units that are linked together through information networks and monitoring at all levels. This paper was prepared as a background paper for the 2010 World Development Report on Climate Change.",

         "volume": "27","number": "1","pages": "115--139","abstract": "The presence of radiatively active gases in the Earth's atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone) raises its global mean surface temperature by 30 K, making our planet habitable by life as we know it. There has been an increase in carbon dioxide and other trace gases since the Industrial Revolution, largely as a result of man's activities, increasing the radiative heating of the troposphere and surface by about 2 W m−2. This heating is likely to be enhanced by resulting changes in water vapor, snow and sea ice, and cloud. The associated equilibrium temperature rise is estimated to be between 1 and 2 K, there being uncertainties in the strength of climate feedbacks, particularly those due to cloud. The large thermal inertia of the oceans will slow the rate of warming, so that the expected temperature rise will be smaller than the equilibrium rise. This increases the uncertainty in the expected warming to date, with estimates ranging from less than 0.5 K to over 1 K. The observed increase of 0.5 K since 1900 is consistent with the lower range of these estimates, but the variability in the observed record is such that one cannot necessarily conclude that the observed temperature change is due to increases in trace gases. The prediction of changes in temperature over the next 50 years depends on assumptions concerning future changes in trace gas concentrations, the sensitivity of climate, and the effective thermal inertia of the oceans. On the basis of our current understanding a further warming of at least 1 K seems likely. Numerical models of climate indicate that the changes will not be uniform, nor will they be confined to temperature. The simulated warming is largest in high latitudes in winter and smallest over sea ice in summer, with little seasonal variation in the tropics. Annual mean precipitation and runoff increase in high latitudes, and most simulations indicate a drier land surface in northern mid-latitudes in summer. The agreement between different models is much better for temperature than for changes in the hydrological cycle. Priorities for future research include developing an improved representation of cloud in numerical models, obtaining a better understanding of vertical mixing in the deep ocean, and determining the inherent variability of the ocean-atmosphere system. Progress in these areas should enable detection of a man-made  \u201D greenhouse\u201D warming within the next two decades.",

Climate change has become the inevitable result of our past actions. According to a report published in India, cities consume two thirds of global energy use and 76\\% of the world's energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) are also emitted by cities through transport, industry, and building and construction related activities. Sustainable development has always been a key consideration for the development of India. Growing and developing our city state in an efficient, clean and green way by utilizing less resources; generating less waste; reducing pollution to the environment. In response to broad concerns regarding the environment and climate change, Green Library are becoming much more common and are increasingly in demand by Libraries. The online Dictionary of Library and Information Science defines Green Libraries as: A Library designed to minimize negative impact on the natural environment and maximize indoor environment quality by means of careful site selection, use of natural construction materials and biodegradable products, conservation of resources (water, energy, paper, responsible waste, disposal, Recycling etc). In new constructing and library renovation, sustainability is increasingly achieved through LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) certification a Rating system developed and administered by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). A Green Library also knows as a Sustainable Library, is a library build with environmental concerns in mind, Green libraries are a part of the larger green building movement. The main aim of this article to identify and create awareness about the reduction of energy consumption and energy cost in the Libraries. The green and energy saving design of library consists of the following parts: integrating energy management system in monitoring and control systems, complex vacuum glazing of building envelope, energy saving illuminating system, convertible frequency air-conditioner of HVAC and rainwater utilization system. In recent years, building energy consumption increased fast in India, especially the public buildings.Based on this research, some possible actions can be suggested for improving Library activities and output indicators towards mitigating the Climate Change and Global Warming.",

To facilitate mitigation and adaptation planning, it is essential to quantify and synthesize climate change impacts and characterize the associated uncertainties. By synergistically using projections of climate scenarios from an ensemble of regional climate models and a spatially explicit version of an empirical health risk model, here we quantify the mortality risk associated with excessive heat stress for people aged over 65 years old across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Our results show that mortality risk is expected to intensify by a factor of 8--20 in the last 30 years of the twenty-first century with respect to the historical period (1951--2005) if no climate change mitigation planning is undertaken. If global warming is limited to 2 °C, the mortality risk is expected to rise by a factor of 3--7 for the same period. Further analyses reveal that much of the increase in mortality risk is due to the increase in frequency of warm days rather than their intensity. Unfortunately, the poorest countries with least contribution to climate change are expected to be most impacted by it, as they will experience higher mortality risks compared to wealthier nations.",

CO2 concentration and Antarctic temperature were positively correlated over millennial-scale climate cycles, implying a strong connection to Southern Ocean processes. Evidence from marine sediment proxies indicates that CO2 concentration rose most rapidly when North Atlantic Deep Water shoaled and stratification in the Southern Ocean was reduced. These increases in CO2 concentration occurred during stadial (cold) periods in the Northern Hemisphere, several thousand years before abrupt warming events in Greenland. 10.1126/science.1160832",

Seventy five percent of total global energy demand is supplied by the burning of fossil fuels. But increasing air pollution, global warming concerns diminishing fossil fuels and their increasing cost have made it necessary to look towards renewable sources as a future energy solution. Since the past decade, there has been an enormous interest in many countries on renewable energy for power generation. This paper has presented a novel control of an existing grid interfacing inverter to improve the power quality at point of common coupling for a 3-phase 4-wire distributed generation system. The inverter is controlled to perform multifunction device by incorporating active power filter functionality. The grid interfacing inverter can be effectively used to compensate the load reactive power, current unbalance and harmonic distortions in addition to active power injection from renewable energy sources. This enables the grid to supply/receive sinusoidal and balanced power at unity power factor. All these functions may be accomplished either individually or simultaneously. This new method is demonstrated with extensive MATLAB/simulink.",

Due to urbanization it is estimated that the production of cement increase up to 200 million ton in 2015. Being development of nation on one side, the side effect grows in form of global warming. Increased rate of industrialization leads to Production of toxic gases like CO, CO2, and other hazardous gases leads to ozone depletion which is main cause of global warming & a threat to environment. CO2 gas contributes in relation to 63.33% of global warming. The factories which manufacture cement are responsible for a quantity of the CO2 gas production because the production of one ton of Portland cement emits around one ton of CO2 into the ambiance. To eliminate the main cause of global threat (CO2), the new idea came in to existence i.e. use of substitute materials in construction industry. For this purpose, the uses of industrial dissipate products and agricultural by products are very beneficial. These industrial dissipate and agricultural by products such as Silica Fume, Rice Husk Ash, Slag, and Fly Ash etc, are capable of used as cementing materials due to their pozzolanic behavior, these products require large tract of lands for dumping. Great amount of dissipate achieve as by products from several of the industries can be the main sources of such alternate materials. The world rice crop is estimated at 596 million tons per year and India is second major producer of rice in the world with yearly production of 146 million tons per year.The RICE HUSK ASH (RHA) can be utilize as a substitute material as replacement for ordinary Portland cement. This technology may possibly decrease the CO2 discharge to the environment caused by the cement industries.In the present study, a possibility has completed to use of Rice Husk Ash as an admixture to substitute of Portland cement in concrete, and an effort has been made to explore the strength parameter of concrete. For control concrete, IS method of mix design has taken on and considering this a basis, mix design for replacement technique has been finished. Five dissimilar replacement levels 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5% and 15% are selected for the study concern to replacement method with range of curing stage starting from 7 days and 28 days are considered in the present study. The watercement ratio used in this study is 0.40.The all results were compared to concrete without RHA. The compressive, split tensile and flexural strength were compared with those concrete without RHA. The results show that the rice husk ash gives the good performance on compressive, split tensile and flexural strength at the age of 28 days of curing. The results were evaluated with the concrete without RHA. The saturated water absorption results shows that the percentage of water absorption of concrete with containing 7.5- 12.5% replacement of cement by RHA is decrease as compare to concrete without containing RHA.

         "abstract": "Abstract The present assessment of the West African monsoon in the models of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) indicates little evolution since CMIP3 in terms of both biases in present-day climate and climate projections. The outlook for precipitation in twenty-first-century coupled simulations exhibits opposite response between the westernmost and eastern Sahel. The spread in the trend amplitude remains however large in both regions. Besides, although all models predict a spring and summer warming of the Sahel, 10 to 50\\% larger than the global warming, their temperature response ranges from 0 to 7 K. CMIP5 coupled models underestimate the monsoon decadal variability, but SST-imposed simulations succeed in capturing the recent partial recovery of monsoon rainfall. Coupled models still display major SST biases in the equatorial Atlantic, inducing a systematic southward shift of the monsoon. Because of these strong biases, the monsoon is further evaluated in SST-imposed simulations along the 10°W?10°E AMMA transect, across a range of timescales ranging from seasonal, intraseasonal and diurnal fluctuations. The comprehensive set of observational data now available allows an in-depth evaluation of the monsoon across those scales, especially through the use of high-frequency outputs provided by some CMIP5 models at selected sites along the AMMA transect. Most models capture many features of the African monsoon with varying degrees of accuracy. In particular, the simulation of the top-of-atmosphere and surface energy balances, in relation with the cloud cover, and the intermittence and diurnal cycle of precipitation, demand further work to achieve a reasonable realism.",

Can the ECO-ECONOMY be achieved? Yes, one of the best solution is carbon credits. Credits can be traded on the carbon markets in the same way as stocks and shares and therefore have intrinsic value. The goal is to allow market mechanisms to carry out successful industrial and commercial processes with considerably low emissions than those used when there is no cost to emitting carbon dioxide and other GHGs into the atmosphere. Since GHG mitigation projects generate credits, this approach can be used to finance carbon reduction schemes between trading partners and around the world.",

While there are few pathways to 2 °C that do not rely on negative emissions, 1.5 °C scenarios are barely conceivable without them.

A meta-database of future crop yields, built up from 16 recent studies, is used to provide an overall assessment of the potential impact of climate change on yields, and to analyze sources of uncertainty. Despite a large dispersion of yield changes ranging from −50\\% to +90\\%, the median is a yield loss near −11\\%. This negative impact is assessed by both empirical and process-based crop models whereas the Ricardian approach gives very contrasted results, even within a single study. The predicted impact is larger in northern West Africa (Sudano-Sahelian countries, −18\\% median response) than in southern West Africa (Guinean countries, −13\\%) which is likely due to drier and warmer projections in the northern part of West Africa. Moreover, negative impacts on crop productivity increase in severity as warming intensifies, with a median yield loss near −15\\% with most intense warming, highlighting the importance of global warming mitigation. The consistently negative impact of climate change results mainly from the temperature whose increase projected by climate models is much larger relative to precipitation change. However, rainfall changes, still uncertain in climate projections, have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate this impact depending on whether rainfall decreases or increases. Finally, results highlight the pivotal role that the carbon fertilization effect may have on the sign and amplitude of change in crop yields. This effect is particularly strong for a high carbon dioxide concentration scenario and for C3 crops (e.g. soybean, cassava). As staple crops are mainly C4 (e.g. maize, millet, sorghum) in WA, this positive effect is less significant for the region.",

At the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 degrees, climate activists and researchers began to look for alternative measures. Climate engineering (CE) - the deliberate manipulation of the planetary environment to decelerate climate change - emerges as a possibly effective, albeit risky and conflictual, option., Aim. This article aims both at simulating a plausible international scenario of negotiation over solar climate engineering deployment, and at utilizing the rules of Model United Nations (MUN) for collaborative learning in a university class. Furthermore, the article intends to provide a framework for simulations about CE that could easily be reproduced., Method. MUN is an established and well-tested foundation for a simulation with students, including preparation leading up to the simulation and feedback rounds afterwards. We repeated the simulation three times, recorded the sessions as well as the debriefings, and gathered interesting insight by comparing the results., Result. For our CE simulations, we discovered: 1. Divergent interests (e.g. global north vs global south). 2. Power struggle (e.g. role of the veto powers). 3. Scientific and political ignorance (e.g. decision-making under uncertainty). 4. Risk politics (e.g. trade-offs between climate change risks vs. CE risks)., Conclusion. MUN qualifies well for simulating a CE crisis. However, known lacks in MUN settings (like underrepresentation of non-state actors) must be discussed during the debriefing. These simulations illustrate possible future conflicts over CE without being prescriptive in any way.",

In Central Asia, one of the most intensively irrigated dryland agricultural regions, climate change is likely to exacerbate the regional water supply\u2013demand gaps, particularly in downstream areas. The withdrawal of degraded, highly salinized croplands from irrigated farming in favor of tree plantations that effectively utilize saline groundwater may contribute to irrigation water saving, which can generate valuable ecosystem services and provide rural income opportunities. To facilitate the spatial planning of afforestation in the lower Amudarya region, we developed a hydrological algorithm to map the spatio-temporal pattern of water supply\u2013demand. The resulting map, based on seven-year continuous data of cropping pattern and corresponding irrigation dynamics, rainfall, and evapotranspiration at 250\u202Fm resolution, revealed the overly irrigated areas from which excess water can be redistributed to water-stressed areas. Furthermore, combining this information with spatial data on marginally productive croplands and with water requirement of tree plantations showed that 67% of these croplands are characterized by water availability sufficient for the introduction of salt-tolerant tree species. The algorithm developed is of potential use for defining the feasibility of introducing alternative (tree) crops with known growth and water use characteristics.",

Photosynthesis is an intricate heat-sensitive physiological process. Heat stress affects CO2 assimilation, photochemical reactions, D1 and D2 protein turnover, and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Heat stress-induced damage to chloroplast downregulates important chloroplast components and inactivates heat-sensitive proteins, including RuBisCo activase, causing redox imbalance, reducing photosynthetic efficiency, and possibly causing cell death. As all photochemical processes in the Calvin cycle in the stroma and thylakoid lamellae of the chloroplast are prone to heat stress injury, these organelles are the primary activators of cellular heat stress responses and signaling. This review describes approaches to protect crop plants against heat-induced photochemical damage and discusses chloroplast responses, sensitivity, and retrograde signaling that contribute to the sensitivity and tolerance of photosynthetic apparatus.",

Indeed, evidence indicates that wave heights have been changing over the last 40 years, although there is no proven link to global warming. Changes in the wave climate will affect wave energy conversion. Where the resource is restricted, there may be reductions in energy exports and, consequently, negative economic impacts.

Economies, societies and ecosystems in South America are vulnerable to such water resource changes. Hence, water resource impact assessments for South America, and corresponding adaptation and mitigation policies, have attracted increased attention. However, substantial uncertainties remain in the current water resource assessments that are based on multiple coupled Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation models. This uncertainty varies from significant wetting to catastrophic drying. By applying a statistical method, we characterized the uncertainty and identified global-scale metrics for measuring the reliability of water resource assessments in South America. Here, we show that, although the ensemble mean assessment suggested wetting across most of South America, the observational constraints indicate a higher probability of drying in the Amazon basin. Thus, over-reliance on the consensus of models can lead to inappropriate decision making.",

We used two measures of thermal shifts from analyses of global temperatures over the past 50 years to describe the pace of climate change that species should track: the velocity of climate change (geographic shifts of isotherms over time) and the shift in seasonal timing of temperatures. Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes, despite slower ocean warming. These indices give a complex mosaic of predicted range shifts and phenology changes that deviate from simple poleward migration and earlier springs or later falls. They also emphasize potential conservation concerns, because areas of high marine biodiversity often have greater velocities of climate change and seasonal shifts.",

         "abstract": "Climate change exposes people to conditions that are historically unusual but that will become increasingly common over time. What kind of weather do people think of as normal or unusual under these changing conditions? We use the volume of social media posts about weather to measure the remarkability of different temperatures and show that remarkability changes rapidly with repeated exposure to unusual temperatures. The reference point for normal conditions appears to be based on weather experienced between 2 and 8 y ago. This rapidly shifting normal baseline means warming noticed by the general public may not be clearly distinguishable from zero over the 21st century, with potential implications for both the acceptance of global warming and public pressure for mitigation policies.The changing global climate is producing increasingly unusual weather relative to preindustrial conditions. In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years\u2014rather than longer historical periods\u2014determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a \u201Cboiling frog\u201D effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.",

Paradoxically, it may be susceptible to changes in climate that will result from rising carbon emissions. Wind patterns are expected to change and this will alter wave regimes. Despite a lack of definite proof of a link to global warming, wind and wave conditions have been changing over the past few decades. Changes in the wind and wave climate will affect offshore wind and wave energy conversion: where the resource is constrained, production and economic performance may suffer; alternatively, stormier climates may create survival issues.

Satellite observations reveal positive trends in GrIS surface melt extent4, but melt variability, intensity and runoff remain uncertain before the satellite era. Here we present the first continuous, multi-century and observationally constrained record of GrIS surface melt intensity and runoff, revealing that the magnitude of recent GrIS melting is exceptional over at least the last 350 years. We develop this record through stratigraphic analysis of central west Greenland ice cores, and demonstrate that measurements of refrozen melt layers in percolation zone ice cores can be used to quantifiably, and reproducibly, reconstruct past melt rates. We show significant (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and spatially extensive correlations between these ice-core-derived melt records and modelled melt rates5,6 and satellite-derived melt duration4 across Greenland more broadly, enabling the reconstruction of past ice-sheet-scale surface melt intensity and runoff. We find that the initiation of increases in GrIS melting closely follow the onset of industrial-era Arctic warming in the mid-1800s, but that the magnitude of GrIS melting has only recently emerged beyond the range of natural variability. Owing to a nonlinear response of surface melting to increasing summer air temperatures, continued atmospheric warming will lead to rapid increases in GrIS runoff and sea-level contributions.",

(Physica A: 396, 42-50, 2014) compared the sunspot number\nrecord and the temperature record and found that they differ: the sunspot\nnumber record is characterized by a dominant 11-year cycle while the\ntemperature record appears to be characterized by a singularity or pole in the\nspectral density function at the zero frequency. Consequently, they claimed\nthat the two records are characterized by substantially different statistical\nfractional models and rejected the hypothesis that sun influences significantly\nglobal temperatures. I show that: (1) the \"singularity\" or \"pole\" in the\nspectral density function of the global surface temperature at the \"zero\"\nfrequency does not exist - it is a typical misinterpretation that discrete\npower spectra of non-stationary signals can suggest; (2) appropriate continuous\nperiodograms clarify the issue and also show a signature of the 11-year solar\ncycle (amplitude &lt;0.1 K), which since 1850 has an average period of about 10.4\nyear, and of many other natural oscillations; (3) the solar signature in the\nsurface temperature record can be recognized only using specific techniques of\nanalysis that take into account non-linearity and filtering of the multiple\nclimate change contributions; (4) the post 1880-year temperature warming trend\ncannot be compared or studied against the sunspot record and its 11-year cycle,\nbut requires solar proxy models showing short and long scale oscillations plus\nthe contribution of anthropogenic forcings, as done in the literature. Multiple\nevidences suggest that global temperatures and sunspot numbers are quite\nrelated to each other at multiple time scales through complex and non-linear\nprocesses. Finally, I show that the prediction of a semi-empirical model for\nthe global temperature based on astronomical oscillations and anthropogenic\nforcing proposed by Scafetta since 2009 has up to date been successful.",

This paper uses a bio-inspired control method called the Digital Hormone Model (DHM) to control the tasking and executing of robot swarms based on local communication, signal propagation, and stochastic reactions. The DHM model is probabilistic, dynamic, fault-tolerant, computationally efficient, and can be easily tasked to change global behavior. Different from most existing distributed control and learning mechanisms, DHM considers the topological structure of the organization, supports dynamic reconfiguration and self-organization, and requires no globally unique identifiers for individual robots. The paper describes the DHM and presents the experimental results on simulating biological observations in the forming of feathers, and simulating wireless communicated swarm behavior at a large scale for attacking target, forming sensor networks, self-repairing, and avoiding pitfalls in mission execution.",

Ionospheric data from ESA's Swarm satellite constellation mission show prominent 6\u2010day variations in the dayside low\u2010latitude region at this time, which can be attributed to forcing from the middle atmosphere by the Rossby normal mode ``quasi\u20106\u2010day wave\u201D (Q6DW). Geopotential height measurements by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard NASA's Aura satellite reveal a burst of global Q6DW activity in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere during the SSW, which is one of the strongest in the record. The Q6DW is apparently generated in the polar stratosphere at 30\u2010\u201040 km, where the atmosphere is unstable due to strong vertical wind shear connected with planetary\u2010wave breaking. These results suggest that an Antarctic SSW can lead to ionospheric variability through wave forcing from the middle atmosphere.",

Current areas of interest, such as Antarctic ozone hole, global warming effects on stratospheric cooling are also addressed. Stratosphere troposphere exchange, transport processes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere and the role of stratosphere on tropospheric weather systems are presented. The information provided in the textbook will have broad applicability in other branches of atmospheric science, and will be of interest to those studying such areas as climate change, extreme weather events, and potential for the prediction of tropospheric weather systems.",

However, slowly evolving salinity drifts can cause large shifts in climatic and oceanic regimes over thousands of years. We test two different schemes for neutralising unforced salinity drifts in the FAMOUS GCM: surface flux correction and volumetric flux correction. Although both methods successfully maintain a steady global mean salinity, local drifts and subsequent feedbacks promote cooling (≈þinspace4 °C over 6000 years) and freshening (≈þinspace2 psu over 6000 years) in the North Atlantic Ocean, and gradual warming (≈þinspace0.2 °C per millennium) and salinification (≈þinspace0.15 psu per millennium) in the North Pacific Ocean. Changes in the surface density in these regions affect the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), such that, after several millennia, the Atlantic MOC (AMOC) is in a collapsed state, and there is a strong, deep Pacific MOC (PMOC). Furthermore, the AMOC exhibits a period of metastability, which is only identifiable with run lengths in excess of 1500 years. We also compare simulations with two different land surface schemes, demonstrating that small biases in the surface climate may cause regional salinity drifts and significant shifts in the MOC (weakening of the AMOC and the initiation then invigoration of PMOC), even when the global hydrological cycle has been forcibly closed. Although there is no specific precursor to the simulated AMOC collapse, the northwest North Pacific and northeast North Atlantic are important areas that should be closely monitored for trends arising from such biases.",

The case of climate change then provides an experimental test case with which to explore the various responses to these challenges offered by Ulrich Beck's reflexive modernization, the normative theory of expertise advanced by Harry Collins and Robert Evans, and Bruno Latour's utopian vision for decision-making by the 'collective' in which traditional epistemic and institutional distinctions between science and politics are entirely superseded.",

Here, we show that the radiative forcing due to geospatially redistributed anthropogenic aerosols mainly determined the spatial variations of winter extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere during 1970\u20132005, a unique transition period for global aerosol forcing4. Over this period, the local Rossby wave activity and extreme events (top 10% in wave amplitude) exhibited marked declining trends at high latitudes, mainly in northern Eurasia. The combination of long-term observational data and a state-of-the-art climate model revealed the unambiguous signature of anthropogenic aerosols on the wintertime jet stream, planetary wave activity and surface temperature variability on interdecadal timescales. In particular, warming due to aerosol reductions in Europe enhanced the meridional temperature gradient on the jet\u2019s poleward flank and strengthened the zonal wind, resulting in significant suppression in extreme events over northern Eurasia. These results exemplify how aerosol forcing can impact large-scale extratropical atmospheric dynamics, and illustrate the importance of anthropogenic aerosols and their spatiotemporal variability in assessing the drivers of extreme weather in historical and future climate.",

Climate models, supported by a growing body of observational data, have demonstrated that storm tracks shift poleward as the climate warms. But the dynamical mechanisms responsible for this shift remain unclear. To isolate what portion of the storm track shift may be accounted for by large-scale dry dynamics alone, disregarding the latent heat released in phase changes of water, this study investigates the storm track shift under various kinds of climate change in an idealized dry general circulation model (GCM) with an adjustable but constant convective stability. It is found that increasing the mean surface temperature or the convective stability leads to poleward shifts of storm tracks, even if the convective stability is increased only in a narrow band around the equator. Under warming and convective stability changes roughly corresponding to a doubling of CO2 concentrations from a present-day Earthlike climate, storm tracks shift about 0.8° poleward, somewhat less than but in qualitative agreement with studies using moist GCMs. About 63\\% (0.5°) of the poleward shift is shown to be caused by tropical convective stability variations. This demonstrates that tropical processes alone (the increased dry static stability of a warmer moist adiabat) can account for part of the poleward shift of storm tracks under global warming. This poleward shift generally occurs in tandem with a poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation; however, the Hadley circulation expansion does not always parallel the storm track shift.",

         "volume": "162","pages": "53-61","abstract": "Global warming is predicted to increase water scarcity in many drylands worldwide. In Central Asia, one of the most intensively irrigated dryland agricultural regions, climate change is likely to exacerbate the regional water supply\u2013demand gaps, particularly in downstream areas. The withdrawal of degraded, highly salinized croplands from irrigated farming in favor of tree plantations that effectively utilize saline groundwater may contribute to irrigation water saving, which can generate valuable ecosystem services and provide rural income opportunities. To facilitate the spatial planning of afforestation in the lower Amudarya region, we developed a hydrological algorithm to map the spatio-temporal pattern of water supply\u2013demand. The resulting map, based on seven-year continuous data of cropping pattern and corresponding irrigation dynamics, rainfall, and evapotranspiration at 250\u202Fm resolution, revealed the overly irrigated areas from which excess water can be redistributed to water-stressed areas. Furthermore, combining this information with spatial data on marginally productive croplands and with water requirement of tree plantations showed that 67% of these croplands are characterized by water availability sufficient for the introduction of salt-tolerant tree species. The algorithm developed is of potential use for defining the feasibility of introducing alternative (tree) crops with known growth and water use characteristics.",

The development focused on correcting errors in and improving the physical processes representation, as well as improving the computational performance, versatility, and overall user friendliness. In addition to new radiation and aerosol parameterizations of the atmosphere, several relatively large, but partly compensating, coding errors in the model's cloud, convection, and turbulence parameterizations were corrected. The representation of land processes was refined by introducing a multilayer soil hydrology scheme, extending the land biogeochemistry to include the nitrogen cycle, replacing the soil and litter decomposition model and improving the representation of wildfires. The ocean biogeochemistry now represents cyanobacteria prognostically in order to capture the response of nitrogen fixation to changing climate conditions and further includes improved detritus settling and numerous other refinements. As something new, in addition to limiting drift and minimizing certain biases, the instrumental record warming was explicitly taken into account during the tuning process. To this end, a very high climate sensitivity of around 7 K caused by low-level clouds in the tropics as found in an intermediate model version was addressed, as it was not deemed possible to match observed warming otherwise. As a result, the model has a climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 over preindustrial conditions of 2.77 K, maintaining the previously identified highly nonlinear global mean response to increasing CO2 forcing, which nonetheless can be represented by a simple two-layer model.",

         "volume": "6","number": "1","pages": "1129-1135","abstract": "Insecurity is the word used to describe the activities of men of the underworld or terrorists which in Nigeria go by different names such as insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, Fulani killer herdsmen, etc. It would appear that the activities of the aforementioned groups have overwhelmed the country on many fronts, food production inclusive. Nigeria has started re thinking agriculture as a viable option for complementing revenue earnings from the oil and gas sector of the economy but insecurity seems to be the major clog in the wheel of progress in this regard, especially when we consider the effect of the activities of bandits, insurgents and Fulani killer herdsmen on small holder farmers across the nation. These developments have deleterious effects on agricultural activities in general, food production and sustainable human development in particular. While there are policies and agencies in the state to combat these developments, it does appear they have proved ineffective in the face of increasing inconsistency in government policies, security problem, open grazing, climate change and global warming. Precisely, the study examined the effect of insecurity on food production in Nigeria, using Ayamelum Local Government Area, Anambra state, Nigeria, the food basket of Anambra State, as the study area. The design of the study is descriptive research survey. The eight communities in the LGA were involved in the study and the target population was the small holder farmers selected conveniently across the communities. Chi Square 2 test of independence was used as the main statistical tool of analysis. The findings revealed that insecurity in form of herders attack on farming communities has significant negative effect on food production in the country. The study concludes that the attack on farmers by the Fulani killer herdsmen is responsible for the rise in prices of agricultural products in the market as farmers have to resort to the hiring of private security operatives to attend to their farming activities throughout the farming season. It was recommended among others that the government should urgently consider the option of ranching as the alternative to open grazing as it is practiced in other civilized societies across the globe.

Impact assessments can be, in many cases, laborious processes leading to inevitable methodological compromises that drastically affect the robustness of the conclusions. In this study we examine the implications of different CMIP5-based regional and global climate model ensembles for projections of the hydrological impacts of climate change. We compare results from three different assessments of hydrological impacts under high-end climate change (RCP8.5) across Europe, and we focus on how methodological differences affect the projections. We assess, as systematically as possible, the differences in runoff projections as simulated by a land surface model driven by three different sets of climate projections over the European continent at global warming of 1.5 &deg;C, 2 &deg;C and 4 &deg;C relative to pre-industrial levels, according to the RCP8.5 concentration scenario. We find that these methodological differences lead to considerably different outputs for a number of indicators used to express different aspects of runoff. We further use a number of new global climate model experiments, with an emphasis on high resolution, to test the assumption that many of the uncertainties in regional climate and hydrological changes are driven predominantly by the prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice concentrations (SICs) and we find that results are more sensitive to the choice of the atmosphere model compared to the driving SSTs. Finally, we combine all sources of information to identify robust patterns of hydrological changes across the European continent.",

         "abstract": "Carbon (C) emissions from wildfires are a key terrestrial\u2013atmosphere interaction that influences global atmospheric composition and climate. Positive feedbacks between climate warming and boreal wildfires are predicted based on top-down controls of fire weather and climate, but C emissions from boreal fires may also depend on bottom-up controls of fuel availability related to edaphic controls and overstory tree composition. Here we synthesized data from 417 field sites spanning six ecoregions in the northwestern North American boreal forest and assessed the network of interactions among potential bottom-up and top-down drivers of C emissions. Our results indicate that C emissions are more strongly driven by fuel availability than by fire weather, highlighting the importance of fine-scale drainage conditions, overstory tree species composition and fuel accumulation rates for predicting total C emissions. By implication, climate change-induced modification of fuels needs to be considered for accurately predicting future C emissions from boreal wildfires.",

Initially, the basics of heat exchangers are briefly provided along with second law analysis which also includes two-phase flow analysis and thermoeconomic analysis. Following this, detail literature survey based on performance parameters such as entropy generation, exergy analysis, production and manufacturing irreversibilities (cumulative exergy destruction associated with the production of material and manufacturing of component or assembly of components) and two phase fluid loss of heat exchangers is presented including constructal law applied to analyze heat exchangers. Constructal theory along with second law analysis can be used for the systematic design of heat exchangers.

However, variability in ultraviolet solar irradiance is linked to modulation of the Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations, suggesting the potential for larger regional surface climate effects. Here, we explore possible impacts through two experiments designed to bracket uncertainty in ultraviolet irradiance in a scenario in which future solar activity decreases to Maunder Minimum-like conditions by 2050. Both experiments show regional structure in the wintertime response, resembling the North Atlantic Oscillation, with enhanced relative cooling over northern Eurasia and the eastern United States. For a high-end decline in solar ultraviolet irradiance, the impact on winter northern European surface temperatures over the late twenty-first century could be a significant fraction of the difference in climate change between plausible AR5 scenarios of greenhouse gas concentrations.",

         "volume": "55","abstract": "Abstract The temperature of river water plays a crucial role in many physical, chemical, and aquatic ecological processes. Despite the importance of having detailed information on this environmental variable at locally relevant scales (≤50 km), high-resolution simulations of water temperature on a large scale are currently lacking. We have developed the dynamical 1-D water energy routing model (DynWat), that solves both the energy and water balance, to simulate river temperatures for the period 1960\u20132014 at a nominal 10-km and 50-km resolution. The DynWat model accounts for surface water abstraction, reservoirs, riverine flooding, and formation of ice, enabling a realistic representation of the water temperature. We present a novel 10-km water temperature data set at the global scale for all major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Validated results against 358 stations worldwide indicate a decrease in the simulated root-mean-square error (0.2 °C) and bias (0.7 °C), going from 50- to 10-km simulations. We find an average global increase in water temperature of 0.16 °C per decade between 1960 and 2014, with more rapid warming toward 2014. Results show increasing trends for the annual daily maxima in the Northern Hemisphere (0.62 °C per decade) and the annual daily minima in the Southern Hemisphere (0.45 °C per decade) for 1960\u20132014. The high-resolution modeling framework not only improves the model performance, it also positively impacts the relevance of the simulations for regional-scale studies and impact assessments in a region without observations. The resulting global water temperature data set could help to improve the accuracy of decision-support systems that depend on water temperature estimates.",

         "abstract": "It is well known that the life adapted to different climates from hot tropical to cold tundra. Earth by its very\r\nintrinsic nature of dynamism offers challenging situations to the life forms which prove disastrous to the life\r\nand property at times extinction species even. The present civilized society is industry oriented and energy\r\nintensive dependant mainly on fossil fuels. The exponential growth in the world population has lead to\r\nconsumption of increasing amounts of fossil fuels. For example, more than half of the world\u2019s oil reserves\r\nand a little less than three fourths of US oil reserves will be consumed during 1950 to 2025- a man\u2019s lifetime.\r\nA century ago mostly the disasters were nature made. But now not only man\u2019s activities are causing\r\ndisasters but also man made disasters are increasing causing loss to life forms including him. The thirst for\r\nnonrenewable resources of energy has price. After use they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\r\ngases affecting the global climate- especially depletion in ozone levels. The consequences of global\r\nwarming in long term may be disastrous to the life forms. Today the high-tech observatories are capable of\r\nimaging the earth with high resolution. This enabled a close look at the earth processes and a good media to\r\ncapture natural and manmade disasters. They show, with increasing evidence, the role of man as a strong\r\ncatalyst.",

CH4 contributes significantly to global warming.\r\nArctic regions are most critically influenced by a changing climate. Modeling approaches are important tools to determine CH4 fluxes of arctic environments. We present two process-based models to calculate methane emission from permafrost soils. Model forcing consists of ECMWF (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) meteorological data which are validated against field measurements. Auxiliary input data is derived from satellite imagery and field measurements. A MERIS-FR land classification scheme is used to upscale emissions. Model results are validated using methane flux measurements on the landscape and small scale carried out in 2006 in the Lena Delta (72?N, 126?E) by Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. The study site is characterized by arctic tundra ecosystems and continuous permafrost.",

It is shown that the near term warming projected under RCP2.6 is greater than under RCP4.5, even though the greenhouse gas forcing is lower. Rapid and substantial reductions in sulphate aerosol emissions due to a reduction of coal burning in RCP2.6 lead to a reduction in the negative shortwave forcing due to aerosol direct and indirect effects. Indirect effects play an important role over the northern hemisphere oceans, especially the subtropical northeastern Pacific where an anomaly of 5\u201310 Wm−2 develops. The pattern of surface temperature change is consistent with the expected response to this surface radiation anomaly, whilst also exhibiting features that reflect redistribution of energy, and feedbacks, within the climate system. These results demonstrate the importance of aerosol emissions as a key source of uncertainty in near term projections of global and regional climate.",

         "abstract": "Abstract Global warming associated with climate change is one of the greatest challenges of today\u2019s world. Increasing emissions of the greenhouse gas \\CO2\\ are considered as a major contributing factor to global warming. One regulating factor of \\CO2\\ exchange between atmosphere and land surface is vegetation. Measurements of land cover changes in combination with modelling the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) can contribute to determine important sources and sinks of CO2. The aim of this study is to accurately model the \\GPP\\ for a region in West Africa with a spatial resolution of 250 m, and the differentiation of \\GPP\\ based on woody and herbaceous vegetation. For this purpose, the Regional Biomass Model (RBM) was applied, which is based on a Light Use Efficiency (LUE) approach. The focus was on the spatial enhancement of the \\RBM\\ from the original 1000\u2013250 m spatial resolution (RBM+). The adaptation to the 250 m scale included the modification of two main input parameters: (1) the fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) based on the 1000 m \\MODIS\\ \\MOD15A2\\ \\FPAR\\ product which was downscaled to 250 m using \\MODIS\\ \\NDVI\\ time series; (2) the fractional cover of woody and herbaceous vegetation, which was improved by using a multi-scale approach. For validation and regional adjustments of \\GPP\\ and the input parameters, in situ data from a climate station and eddy covariance measurements were integrated. The results of this approach show that the input parameters could be improved significantly: downscaling considerably reduces data gaps of the original \\FPAR\\ product and the improved dataset differed less than 5.0% from the original data for cloud free regions. The \\RMSE\\ of the fractional vegetation cover varied between 5.1 and 12.7%. Modelled \\GPP\\ showed a slight overestimation in comparison to eddy covariance measurements. The in situ data was exceeded by 8.8% for 2005 and by 2.0% for 2006. The model results were converted to \\NPP\\ and also agreed well with previous \\NPP\\ measurements reported from different studies. Altogether a high accuracy and suitability of the regionally adjusted and downscaled model RBM+ can be concluded. The differentiation between vegetation growth forms allows a separation of long-term and short-term carbon storage based on woody and herbaceous vegetation, respectively.",

However, the strong time\u2013space variability of extreme rainfall makes it difficult to detect meaningful trends in the regime of their occurrence for recent years. Using an integrated regional approach, it is shown that over the last 10 years, the Sahelian rainfall regime is characterized by a lasting deficit of the number of rainy days, while at the same time the extreme rainfall occurrence is on the rise. As a consequence, the proportion of annual rainfall associated with extreme rainfall has increased from 17% in 1970\u20131990 to 19% in 1991\u20132000 and to 21% in 2001\u20132010. This tends to support the idea that a more extreme climate has been observed over 2001\u20132010: this climate is drier in the sense of a persisting deficit of rainfall occurrence compared to 1950\u20131969, while at the same time there is an increased probability of extreme daily rainfall.",

Since they have a high global warming potential, other alternatives as, e.g. fluorinated ethers or cyclic hydrocarbons are considered as next-generation refrigerants. Screening of alternative refrigerants is difficult because mostly no or only few data are available. To evaluate, e.g. the cycle performance, the thermodynamic properties of the refrigerants must be known and described accurately by an equation of state. Here, the physically based BACKONE equations are used to describe alternative refrigerants, such as natural refrigerants, hydrofluorocarbons, fluorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, and fluorinated ethers. BACKONE needs only a few substance specific parameters to describe thermodynamic properties with high accuracy. Thus, even alternative refrigerants, with very few available experimental data can be described. Calculations with BACKONE of the performance of many refrigerants show that some hydrocarbons and fluorinated ethers are a good alternative.",

India presently has an installed power generation capacity of 281,423MW.The peak power deficit'\u201Dshortfall in supply of power when the demand is maximum'\u201Dwas 5.2% in year 2013-14. Electricity demand in India is very high due to population of 121 crores. Production of electricity is mainly done by fossil fuels. They release gasses and particulates when they burn. Gasses are usually invisible, and include carbon dioxide, which has impacts on the global environment by accelerating global warming. Other gasses, like carbon monoxide, have impacts within the home, by affecting breathing and reducing the oxygen content of the blood. Fossil fuels are depleting at a very fast rate and the production of electricity by them is not eco-friendly. For sustainable development and to reduce the environmental pollution Solar Passive Architecture is best option specially for building sector. Solar energy is genesis for all forms of energy. With its pollution free nature, virtually inexhaustible supply and global distribution- solar energy is very attractive energy resource. Making a building comfortable for human occupation with the minimum use of electricity consumption is called the Solar Passive Architecture.

The aim is to provide a basis for probabilistic predictions in which the impact of prior assumptions and observational constraints can be clearly distinguished. Here we report on the first perturbed physics coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean model ensemble in which poorly constrained atmosphere, land and sea-ice component parameters are varied in the third version of the Hadley Centre model (the variation of ocean parameters will be the subject of future study). Flux adjustments are employed, both to reduce regional sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases and also to admit the use of combinations of model parameter values which give non-zero values for the global radiation balance. This improves the extent to which the ensemble provides a credible basis for the quantification of uncertainties in climate change, especially at a regional level. However, this particular implementation of flux-adjustments leads to a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, resulting in the development of biases in SST and sea ice in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, model versions are produced which are of similar quality to the unperturbed and un-flux-adjusted version. The ensemble is used to simulate pre-industrial conditions and a simple scenario of a 1\\% per year compounded increase in CO2. The range of transient climate response (the 20 year averaged global warming at the time of CO2 doubling) is 1.5\u20132.6°C, similar to that found in multi-model studies.

This paper is aimed to evaluate the level of heavy metal in carrot and tomatoes cultivated in two farming communities in Kazaure Local Government Area, Jigawa State, Nigeria. The heavy metals were analysed using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The result showed that the mean levels concentration of heavy metals from carrot and tomatoes fruit cultivated from the two farming communities in Kazaure namely Gada and Firji farming areas. The heavy Ni, Cd, Fe, Pb, Mn, Zn and Cr concentration for carrots cultivated at Gada farming area were ranged from 0.06 0.09 mg kg, 0.08 0.09 mg kg, 8.24 8.91 mg kg,0.13 0.23 mg kg,1.23 ,1.56 1.67 mg kg and 0.02 0.04 mg kg respectively. The heavy metals As Cu and Co were not detected in the fruits of carrot for cultivated in both two farming areas. While the mean concentration obtained from tomatoes fruits from the Gada and Firji farming areas ranged from 0.14 0.16 mg kg, 0.06 0.07 mg kg, 6.11 6.12 mg kg, 0.97 0,99 mg kg, 1.11 1.23 mg kg, 0.35 0.39 mg kg for Ni, Cd, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cr respectively. While As, Cu, Pb and Co were not found in tomatoes harvested from the two farming communities. The study concludes that the level of some heavy metals analysed in carrot and tomatoes fruits were found within the permissible level except lead and cadmium. Ibrahim M.

We applied 10 TBMs to the multifactor Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment in Wyoming, USA. Our goals were to investigate how multifactor experiments can be used to constrain models and to identify a road map for model improvement. We found models performed poorly in ambient conditions; there was a wide spread in simulated above\u2010ground net primary productivity (range: 31\u2013390 g C m−2 yr−1). Comparison with data highlighted model failures particularly with respect to carbon allocation, phenology, and the impact of water stress on phenology. Performance against the observations from single\u2010factors treatments was also relatively poor. In addition, similar responses were predicted for different reasons across models: there were large differences among models in sensitivity to water stress and, among the N cycle models, N availability during the experiment. Models were also unable to capture observed treatment effects on phenology: they overestimated the effect of warming on leaf onset and did not allow CO2\u2010induced water savings to extend the growing season length. Observed interactive (CO2 × warming) treatment effects were subtle and contingent on water stress, phenology, and species composition. As the models did not correctly represent these processes under ambient and single\u2010factor conditions, little extra information was gained by comparing model predictions against interactive responses. We outline a series of key areas in which this and future experiments could be used to improve model predictions of grassland responses to global change.",

Especially during summertime heatwaves, extreme daytime as well as high nighttime temperatures expose vulnerable people to potentially deadly heat risk. This applies specifically to indoor air temperatures, since people spend a lot of their time indoors. Against this background, this study relates outdoor and indoor air temperature measurements to area-wide geospatial data regarding summertime urban heat in the city of Augsburg, Germany. Air temperature data is collected from formalized as well as citizen science measurements, while remote sensing data with very-high spatial resolution (VHR) is utilized for assessment of their drivers and influencing factors. A land use regression approach is developed for city-wide modeling of outdoor and indoor air temperatures at the level of individual residential buildings. Daytime outdoor temperatures could be largely explained by vegetation parameters and imperviousness, whereas nighttime temperatures were more related to the building stock and radiation properties. For indoor temperatures, building density as well as building height and volume are additionally relevant. Outdoor air temperatures could be modeled with higher accuracies (mean absolute error (MAE) < 0.5 °C) compared to indoor temperatures (MAE < 1.5 °C), whereas outdoor and indoor modeling results are consistent with well-known patterns across different local climate zones (LCZ).",

Model experiments are performed for the winters with the most (1982/83) and least (1995/96) Arctic ice coverage during 1979?99, when ice concentration estimates were available from satellites. The experiments consist of 50-member ensembles: using large ensembles proved critical to distinguish the signal from noise. The local response to ice anomalies over the subpolar seas of both the Atlantic and Pacific is robust and generally shallow with large upward surface heat fluxes (>100 W m?2), near-surface warming, enhanced precipitation, and below-normal sea level pressure where sea ice receded, and the reverse where the ice expanded. The large-scale response to reduced (enhanced) ice extent to the east (west) of Greenland during 1982/83 resembles the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) with a ridge over the poles and a trough at midlatitudes. The large-scale response was distinctly different in the Pacific, where ice extent anomalies in the Sea of Okhotsk generate a wave train that extends downstream over North America but the wave train response is greatly diminished when the model is driven by ice concentration rather than ice extent anomalies. Comparing the AGCM response to observations suggests that the feedback of the ice upon the atmospheric circulation is positive (negative) in the Pacific (Atlantic) sector. The magnitude of the wintertime response to ice extent anomalies is modest, on the order of 20 m at 500 mb. However, the 500-mb height anomalies roughly double in strength over much of the Arctic when forced by ice concetration anomalies. Furthermore, the NAO-like response increases linearly with the aerial extent of the Atlantic ice anomalies and thus could be quite large if the ice edge retreats as a result of global warming.",

To assess future threats, the majority of studies used process-based crop models, but their ability to represent effects of high temperature has been questioned. Here we show that an ensemble of nine crop models reproduces the observed average temperature responses of US maize, soybean and wheat yields. Each day >30\u2009°C diminishes maize and soybean yields by up to 6% under rainfed conditions. Declines observed in irrigated areas, or simulated assuming full irrigation, are weak. This supports the hypothesis that water stress induced by high temperatures causes the decline. For wheat a negative response to high temperature is neither observed nor simulated under historical conditions, since critical temperatures are rarely exceeded during the growing season. In the future, yields are modelled to decline for all three crops at temperatures >30\u2009°C. Elevated CO2 can only weakly reduce these yield losses, in contrast to irrigation.",

This study uses survey data from nations of the European Union to examine sociodemographic differences among individuals and national differences in levels and processes of support for nuclear energy. Results based on multilevel models for 27 to 29 European nations reveal relatively low support for nuclear energy, even among those concerned about climate change, but consistent patterns of determinants. At the individual level, high socioeconomic status tends to increase support for nuclear energy. At the national level, the presence of operating nuclear power plants in a country leads to higher public support. Both these results more strongly support arguments focusing on the importance of familiarity with the technology than arguments focusing on postmaterialist values. In addition, rightist political views increase support for nuclear energy, but political divisions prove particularly important in high-income nations with postmaterialist values.",

A representative national sample of Americans read predictions about effects of global warming on sea level that included either a worst-case scenario (high partially bounded uncertainty) or the best and worst cases (fully bounded uncertainty). Compared to a control condition, expressing fully bounded but not high partially bounded uncertainty increased trust in scientists and message acceptance. However, these effects were eliminated when fully bounded uncertainty was accompanied by an acknowledgement that the full effects of sea-level rise cannot be quantified because of unpredictable storm surges. Thus, expressions of fully bounded uncertainty alone may enhance confidence in scientists and their assertions but not when the full extent of inevitable uncertainty is acknowledged.",

Modeling approaches are important tools to determine CH4 fluxes of arctic environments. We present two process-based models to calculate methane emission from permafrost soils. Model forcing consists of ECMWF (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) meteorological data which are validated against field measurements. Auxiliary input data is derived from satellite imagery and field measurements. A MERIS-FR land classification scheme is used to upscale emissions.

         "abstract": "An incisive diagnosis of America's economic meltdown. Searingly indicts decades of technological complacency and anti-scientific propaganda that's left America hostage to energy cartels, inept bailout-seekers, cripplingly obsolete technology and worthless financial paper. Formidably informed yet cracklingly vivid and compulsively readable. Johns Hopkins University's chief technology enterprise expert former COO of a multibillion-dollar high-tech firm and an honored scholar / former Reader's Digest senior editor show how modern America was created by technology but lost its technological nerve around the 1960s. Showing that innovation isn't spontaneous but demands careful nurture, and blending fascinating facts with triumphant optimism about the 21st century, it argues that 'returning America to the technology standard' can build a magnificent civilization with mass employment, environmental wisdom and energy sufficiency. A brilliant intellectual detective story, lucidly explaining how nanotechnology, the knowledge economy, magnetic levitation, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, global warming, energy research, the Internet and physics are intertwined and relate urgently to government policy.",

The use of ethanol as a mixed fuel and bio fuel made from vegetable oil improves engine performance. To boost engine performance, oxygen containing additives such methanol, ethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE , and mono alkyl esters of fatty acids are utilised. This study also discusses the various types of bio fuel that are mixed with petroleum products, exhaust emissions, and blending programmes in India. These studies show that a blend of biofuel and petroleum product has less ozone depletion and global warming potential than pure fossil fuel.

         "volume": "281","pages": "113228","abstract": "Warming induced shifts in tundra vegetation composition and structure, including circumpolar expansion of shrubs, modifies ecosystem structure and functioning with potentially global consequences due to feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate. Satellite-derived vegetation indices indicate widespread greening of the surface, often associated with regional evidence of shrub expansion obtained from long-term ecological monitoring and repeated orthophotos. However, explicitly quantifying shrub expansion across large scales using satellite observations requires characterising the fine-scale mosaic of Arctic vegetation types beyond index-based approaches. Although previous studies have illustrated the potential of estimating fractional cover of various Plant Functional Types (PFTs) from satellite imagery, limited availability of reference data across space and time has constrained deriving fraction cover time series capable of detecting shrub expansion. We applied regression-based unmixing using synthetic training data to build multitemporal machine learning models in order to estimate fractional cover of shrubs and other surface components in the Mackenzie Delta Region for six time intervals between 1984 and 2020. We trained Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal-metrics and synthetic training data generated from pure class spectra obtained directly from the imagery. Independent validation using very-high-resolution imagery suggested that KRR outperforms RFR, estimating shrub cover with a MAE of 10.6% and remaining surface components with MAEs between 3.0 and 11.2%. Canopy-forming shrubs were well modelled across all cover densities, coniferous tree cover tended to be overestimated and differentiating between herbaceous and lichen cover was challenging. Shrub cover expanded by on average + 2.2% per decade for the entire study area and + 4.2% per decade within the low Arctic tundra, while relative changes were strongest in the northernmost regions. In conjunction with shrub expansion, we observed herbaceous plant and lichen cover decline. Our results corroborate the perception of the replacement and homogenisation of Arctic vegetation communities facilitated by the competitive advantage of shrub species under a warming climate. The proposed method allows for multidecadal quantitative estimates of fractional cover at 30 m resolution, initiating new opportunities for mapping past and present fractional cover of tundra PFTs and can help advance our understanding of Arctic shrub expansion within the vast and heterogeneous tundra biome.",

         "abstract": "Abstract Global warming associated with climate change is one of the greatest challenges of today\u2019s world. Increasing emissions of the greenhouse gas \\CO2\\ are considered as a major contributing factor to global warming. One regulating factor of \\CO2\\ exchange between atmosphere and land surface is vegetation. Measurements of land cover changes in combination with modelling the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) can contribute to determine important sources and sinks of CO2. The aim of this study is to accurately model the \\GPP\\ for a region in West Africa with a spatial resolution of 250 m, and the differentiation of \\GPP\\ based on woody and herbaceous vegetation. For this purpose, the Regional Biomass Model (RBM) was applied, which is based on a Light Use Efficiency (LUE) approach. The focus was on the spatial enhancement of the \\RBM\\ from the original 1000\u2013250 m spatial resolution (RBM+). The adaptation to the 250 m scale included the modification of two main input parameters: (1) the fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) based on the 1000 m \\MODIS\\ \\MOD15A2\\ \\FPAR\\ product which was downscaled to 250 m using \\MODIS\\ \\NDVI\\ time series; (2) the fractional cover of woody and herbaceous vegetation, which was improved by using a multi-scale approach. For validation and regional adjustments of \\GPP\\ and the input parameters, in situ data from a climate station and eddy covariance measurements were integrated. The results of this approach show that the input parameters could be improved significantly: downscaling considerably reduces data gaps of the original \\FPAR\\ product and the improved dataset differed less than 5.0% from the original data for cloud free regions. The \\RMSE\\ of the fractional vegetation cover varied between 5.1 and 12.7%. Modelled \\GPP\\ showed a slight overestimation in comparison to eddy covariance measurements. The in situ data was exceeded by 8.8% for 2005 and by 2.0% for 2006. The model results were converted to \\NPP\\ and also agreed well with previous \\NPP\\ measurements reported from different studies. Altogether a high accuracy and suitability of the regionally adjusted and downscaled model RBM+ can be concluded. The differentiation between vegetation growth forms allows a separation of long-term and short-term carbon storage based on woody and herbaceous vegetation, respectively.",

         "abstract": "Stomata are small adjustable pores on the surface of aerial plant tissues. The pores open to facilitate uptake of carbon dioxide and close to limit the loss of water. Consistent with this function, stomata open in the light to enable photosynthesis and close during drought. Stomatal movements are forced by changes in the volume of two guard cells that are positioned on either side of the pore. During stomatal opening, guard cells accumulate potassium salts, causing an osmotically driven uptake of water. Owing to the influx of water the guard cells swell and bend, thereby pushing each other apart and creating an open pore in the middle. Various environmental signals, such as light, carbon dioxide and humidity, influence the ion-transport machinery within the guard cell and thus alter stomatal movement. Because of their role in regulating carbon dioxide uptake and transpiration of water, stomata are likely to play a key role in the adaption of plants to the anticipated global warming.",

DSR fluxes have been computed with a physical deterministic radiation transfer model, which uses satellite and reanalysis climatological input data. FA objectively groups grid points with common temporal variability of solar radiation, identifying areas with characteristic solar radiation variability and revealing teleconnection patterns. The globally distributed DSR exhibits strong variability and can be represented by about 30 factors (sub-areas) explaining approximately 85\\% of the total variance. The main factors are located in the tropical Pacific (El Niño Southern Oscillation), the northern Pacific (Aleutian low), desert areas (Africa, Middle East, and Australia), and oceanic areas (storm track zone around 60°S). Furthermore, some of these areas are teleconnected indicating common DSR variability in remote places of the Earth. The primary physical parameter for the co-variability of surface solar radiation is found to be cloud cover. The time series of the factor scores (solar radiation) exhibit features associated with natural climatic phenomena (e.g. NAO, ENSO), thus revealing that DSR might be considered as an indirect indicator for these phenomena. On the other hand, DSR determines these phenomena through its effects on major climate parameters such as surface temperature or evaporation, thus playing a key role in their formation and explanation. Finally, our analysis revealed some statistically significant trends of solar radiation, for example, a reduction in the northern Pacific and an increase in tropical and subtropical regions, which are important for global dimming/brightening and associated surface warming of the Earth.

Air traffic already plays a strong role in driving climate change and is projected to grow\u2014with only limited technical potential for decarbonizing this means of transport. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the expansion of air traffic or even facilitate a reduction in affluent countries. Effective policies and behavioral change, especially among frequent flyers, can help to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For both, a positive evaluation and public support is indispensable. This study contributes to understanding air travel behavior and the perception of regulative policies. We examined the role of attitudes, perceived behavioral control, efficacy, global identity, and justice concerns for intentions to avoid flights and aviation-related environmental policy support. We conducted an online survey study with a quota sample of N = 2,530 participants in Germany. The strongest positive predictors of intentions to refrain from flying and policy support were perceived behavioral control to travel without flying, efficacy beliefs that avoiding air travel contributes to climate change mitigation, and intergenerational justice concerns; pro-travel attitude was a negative predictor. Moreover, we tested whether the provision of additional information on climate impact, global and intranational inequalities as well as subsidies (implying intranational inequality) affected the intention to avoid air travel and policy support. We found no effects of the different types of information. Nor did we find an interaction between the type of information provided and global or national identity. Our results highlight the need for a shift within the mobility sector that facilitates attractive and accessible transport alternatives in order to strengthen people\u2019s behavioral control to choose other means than planes and their efficacy perceptions. Moreover, raising awareness of the impacts of climate change on future generations and developing strategies to promote people\u2019s concern for intergenerational justice might motivate people to reduce air travel and thereby contribute to a livable future for new generations.",

Most models showed high pattern correlations. With respect to the explained spatial variance, many models showed serious large-scale deficiencies, especially at mid-latitudes. Five models performed well at all latitudes and for each month of the year. Three models had a reasonable skill.  We selected the five models with the best pressure patterns for a more detailed assessment of their simulations of the climate in Central Europe. We analysed observations and simulations of monthly mean geostrophic flow indices and of monthly mean temperature and precipitation. We used three geostrophic flow indices: the west component and south component of the geostrophic wind at the surface and the geostrophic vorticity. We found that circulation biases were important, and affected precipitation in particular. Apart from these circulation biases, the models showed other biases in temperature and precipitation, which were for some models larger than the circulation induced biases. For the 21st century the five models simulated quite different changes in circulation, precipitation and temperature. Precipitation changes appear to be primarily caused by circulation changes. Since the models show widely different circulation changes, especially in late summer, precipitation changes vary widely between the models as well. Some models simulate severe drying in late summer, while one model simulates significant precipitation increases in late summer. With respect to the mean temperature the circulation changes were important, but not dominant. However, changes in the distribution of monthly mean temperatures, do show large indirect influences of circulation changes. Especially in late summer, two models simulate very strong warming of warm months, which can be attributed to severe summer drying in the simulations by these models. The models differ also significantly in the simulated warming of cold winter months. Finally, the models simulate rather different changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature, which is likely to impact on changes in temperature and precipitation. These results imply that several important aspects of climate change in Central Europe are highly uncertain. Other aspects of the simulated climate change appear to be more robust. All models simulate significant warming all year round and an increase in precipitation in the winter half-year.",

This is the highest resolution coupled global climate model to be used to study the impacts of an AMOC slowdown so far. Many results found are consistent with previous studies and can be considered robust impacts from a large reduction or collapse of the AMOC. These include: widespread cooling throughout the North Atlantic and northern hemisphere in general; less precipitation in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes; large changes in precipitation in the tropics and a strengthening of the North Atlantic storm track. The focus on Europe, aided by the increase in resolution, has revealed previously undiscussed impacts, particularly those associated with changing atmospheric circulation patterns. Summer precipitation decreases (increases) in northern (southern) Europe and is associated with a negative summer North Atlantic Oscillation signal. Winter precipitation is also affected by the changing atmospheric circulation, with localised increases in precipitation associated with more winter storms and a strengthened winter storm track. Stronger westerly winds in winter increase the warming maritime effect while weaker westerlies in summer decrease the cooling maritime effect. In the absence of these circulation changes the cooling over Europe's landmass would be even larger in both seasons. The general cooling and atmospheric circulation changes result in weaker peak river flows and vegetation productivity, which may raise issues of water availability and crop production.",

Impacts of warming water on oceanic species are most likely to be detected as changes in distribution. Pelagic fishes, in particular, respond to changes in ocean temperature, and modify their distribution on seasonal and interannual timescales, and thus are likely to do so in the future. Global climate models provide insight into possible future conditions, but there is also considerable uncertainty regarding future changes because of differences in model structure and future scenarios. To address some of this uncertainty, I considered output from multiple climate models through an ensemble analysis and examined potential changes in the distribution of large pelagic fishes captured by longline fisheries on the east and west coast of Australia by the year 2100. For the east coast, over 95\\% of model predictions for 14 pelagic species (tunas and billfishes) suggested that core range would move south, and be smaller than what occurs presently. There was less certainty for the west coast, although the core range for all 14 species moved south and was smaller for 63\\% and larger for 37\\% of scenario-model combinations. The overall rate of predicted habitat movement for the suite of pelagic species averaged about 40&\\#xa0;km/decade. While relatively coarse, these predictions give some confidence to stakeholders about likely changes in future distribution for these regionally important pelagic fishes.",

In the UK as in a number of other countries, there is a real danger that responses in anticipation of global warming and climate change - including growing reliance on air-conditioning - will increase energy demand and CO 2 emissions even further. This is an appropriate moment to reflect on the history and future of comfort, both as an idea and as a material reality. Based on interviews and discussions with UK policy makers and building practitioners involved in specifying and constructing what will become the indoor environments of the future, four possible scenarios are identified each with different implications for energy and resource consumption. By actively promoting debate about the indoor environment and associated ways of life, it may yet be possible to avoid becoming locked into social and technical trajectories that are ultimately unsustainable. The aim of this paper is to inspire and initiate just such a discussion through demonstrating that comfort is a highly negotiable socio-cultural construct.",

Renewable energy sources RES like sun, biomass, air, water etc. are environmental friendly and have plenty of potential that can be utilized in power generation. However, RES have a problem of intermittent in nature that can be conquered presently by combining RES known as hybrid system that can provide the reliable, economic and environment friendly electricity. The increased penetration of grid connected renewable energy sources has an impact on the grid power quality in particular weak grids. Voltage fluctuation, frequency fluctuation and harmonics are major power quality issues.

         "abstract": "Earth\u2019s equator-to-pole temperature gradient drives westerly mid-latitude jet streams through thermal wind balance1. In the upper atmosphere, anthropogenic climate change is strengthening this meridional temperature gradient by cooling the polar lower stratosphere2,3 and warming the tropical upper troposphere4\u20136, acting to strengthen the upper-level jet stream7. In contrast, in the lower atmosphere, Arctic amplification of global warming is weakening the meridional temperature gradient8\u201310, acting to weaken the upper-level jet stream. Therefore, trends in the speed of the upper-level jet stream11\u201313 represent a closely balanced tug-of-war between two competing effects at different altitudes14. It is possible to isolate one of the competing effects by analysing the vertical shear\u2014the change in wind speed with height\u2014instead of the wind speed, but this approach has not previously been taken. Here we show that, although the zonal wind speed in the North Atlantic polar jet stream at 250 hectopascals has not changed since the start of the observational satellite era in 1979, the vertical shear has increased by 15 per cent (with a range of 11\u201317 per cent) according to three different reanalysis datasets15\u201317. We further show that this trend is attributable to the thermal wind response to the enhanced upper-level meridional temperature gradient. Our results indicate that climate change may be having a larger impact on the North Atlantic jet stream than previously thought. The increased vertical shear is consistent with the intensification of shear-driven clear-air turbulence expected from climate change18\u201320, which will affect aviation in the busy transatlantic flight corridor by creating a more turbulent flying environment for aircraft. We conclude that the effects of climate change and variability on the upper-level jet stream are being partly obscured by the traditional focus on wind speed rather than wind shear.",

         "abstract": "Observational records and climate model projections reveal a considerable decline in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Changes in the AMOC can have a significant impact on the global climate. Sustained warming due to increased greenhouse gas emissions is projected to weaken the AMOC, which in turn can lead to changes in the location of Inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), oceanic and atmospheric large-scale circulation, tropical precipitation and regional monsoons. Using proxy records, observations and CMIP6 simulations of IITM Earth System Model (IITM-ESM), we investigate the changes in the AMOC and associated changes in the large-scale circulation and precipitation patterns over the South Asian monsoon region. Transient CO2 simulation and additional model sensitivity experiments with realistic surface heat and freshwater perturbation anomalies under the experimental protocol of Flux Anomaly Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (FAFMIP) performed with IITM-ESM reveal a decline in the strength of AMOC. The weakening of AMOC is associated with enhanced heat and freshwater forcing in the North Atlantic resulting in the reduction of northward oceanic heat transport and an enhanced northward atmospheric heat transport. Changes in AMOC lead to weakening of large-scale north--south temperature gradient and regional land-sea thermal gradient, which in turn weaken the regional Hadley circulation and, monsoon circulation over the South Asian region. Both the FAFMIP and transient CO2 experiments reveal consistent results of weakening South Asian Monsoon circulation with a decline of AMOC, while precipitation exhibits contrasting responses as precipitation changes are dominated by the thermodynamic response. The suite of observational and numerical analysis provides a mechanistic hypothesis for the weakening of South Asian monsoon circulation concomitant with a weakening of AMOC in a warming climate.",

The standard 38\u2010level version of the model extends to an altitude of 39 km (∼3 mbar) while the extended 60\u2010level version has enhanced stratospheric resolution and reaches 84 km altitude (∼0.004 mbar). We show that the L60 model captures SSW events earlier than the L38 model (12 days before an event compared with 8 days) and influences the simulation of European surface winter cold spells at seasonal time scales, highlighting the benefit of high vertical resolution and daily initialization for seasonal forecasting. This is likely due to earlier initialization of the downward\u2010propagating SSW signal in the higher\u2010top L60 model. We suggest however that the increased lead time for predicting SSW events is unlikely to be improved much further by raising the model lid above the L60 model domain.",

They are also environmentally more sustainable than heat pumps for seven categories. However, their potential is hampered because they need a back-up heating system, typically gas boiler.

The overall data analysis revealed the better performance of ARIMA in terms of index of agreement (d = 0.79), root-mean-square error (RMSE = 32.8 mm) and mean absolute error (MAE = 25.55 mm) than the triple ESM (d = 0.76; RMSE = 39.86 mm; MAE = 35.02 mm) and double ESM (d = 0.14; RMSE = 52.71 mm; MAE = 45.99 mm) models.

Due to a possible weakening of the North Atlantic Current, it is difficult to predict whether the climate in the Faroe Islands will be warmer or colder as a result of global warming. Therefore, two scenarios are proposed. The first scenario assumes an increase in summer and winter temperature of 2 oC, and the second a decrease in summer and winter temperature of 2 oC. Location Temperate, low alpine and alpine areas in the northern and central part of the Faroe Islands. Methods The responses of 12 different plant species in the Faroe Islands were tested against measured soil temperature, expressed as Tmin, Tmax, snow cover and growing degree days (GDD), using generalised linear modelling (GLM). Results The tolerance to changes in winter soil temperature (0.3-0.8 oC) was found to be lower than the tolerance to changing summer soil temperature (0.7-1.0 oC), and in both cases lower than the predicted climate changes. Conclusions The species most affected by a warming scenario are those that are found with a limited distribution restricted to the uppermost parts of the mountains, especially Salix herbacea, Racomitrium fasciculare, and Bistorta vivipara. For other species, the effect will mainly be a general upward migration. The most vulnerable species are those with a low tolerance, especially Calluna vulgaris, and also Empetrum nigrum, and Nardus stricta. If the climate in the Faroe Islands should become colder, the most vulnerable species are those at low altitudes. A significantly lower temperature would be expected to produce a serious reduction in the extent of Vaccinium myrtillus and Galium saxatilis. Species like Empetrum nigrum, Nardus stricta, and Calluna vulgaris may also be vulnerable. In any case, these species can be expected to migrate downwards.",

         "abstract": "Abstract Regional climate models aim to improve local climate simulations by resolving topography, vegetation, and land use at a finer resolution than global climate models. Lakes, particularly large and deep lakes, are local features that significantly alter regional climate. The Hostetler lake model, a version of which is currently used in the Community Land Model, performs poorly in deep lakes when coupled to the regional climate of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Regional Climate Model Version Four (RegCM4). Within the default RegCM4 model, the lake fails to properly stratify, stifling the model?s ability to capture interannual variability in lake temperature and ice cover. Here, we improve modeled lake stratification and eddy diffusivity while correcting errors in the ice model. The resulting simulated lake shows improved stratification and interannual variability in lake ice and temperature. The lack of circulation and explicit mixing continues to stifle the model?s ability to simulate lake mixing events and variability in timing of stratification and de-stratification. The changes to modeled lake conditions alter seasonal means in sea-level pressure, temperature, and low-level winds in the entire model domain, highlighting the importance of lake model selection and improvement for coupled simulations. Interestingly, changes to winter and spring snow cover and albedo impact spring warming. Unsurprisingly, lake variability is not a first order control of regional climate variability, and increases in the magnitude of lake variability but does not necessarily increase regional climate variability.",

India has immense biological diversity due to availability of various ecological habitats. This biodiversity has been endangered and threatened globally due to loss of habitats, exploitation, over consumption, unregulated trade, poaching, pollution and global warming remarkably after decade of 1950. The boi-wealth is decreasing very speedly due to illegel human activities. India is also facing this problem. To conserve and protect biodiversity many local measures were also done in India in ancient time. But the level of loss of biodiversity has increased so much during 20th century. Although there are so many acts and legislations related to biodiversity conservation governing the rules directly or indirectly. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 has a great impotance in history of consevation of Biological resources in India. National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) was established in the year 2003 which is a body to implement this act properly in the country. This progressive act addresses several aspects relating to conservation and management of biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge, equitable sharing of benefits from the use of biological resources, regulated access to biological and genetic resources, many provisions regarding benefit sharing to access and transfer of biological resources or knowledge for various purposes. The Act is implemented for conservation of biodiversity and benefit of public through National Biodiversity Aithority (NBA) at national level, State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs) at state level and Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) at local level. The NBA takes measures to protect the biological diversity of the country and oppose the grant of intellectual property rights to any other country on any biological resource of India or its knowledge. On the recommendations of National Biodiversity Authority many areas of biological importance have been set up as heritage sites.",

Some microalgae strains collect more lipids, develop faster, and produce more photosynthetic energy than land plants, making them a promising candidate as a biofuel feedstock. Although algae biofuels show promise as an alternative to fossil fuels, several challenges must be conquered before they can successfully compete in the fuel market and be widely embraced. Strain identification and improvement for oil productivity and farming techniques, fertilizer and budget utilization and usage, and co product generation to enhance the systems overall profitability are all issues that need to be addressed. There is much more to be done in the sector, even though there is much enthusiasm about the possibilities of algal biofuels. Algaes generation capacity was all the rage in the green technology scene a decade ago. Compared to traditional feed stocks derived from plant commodities like sugar cane and maize, or even vegetable and animal waste streams, algae fuel, also referred to as third generation biofuel, offers many significant benefits. In light of recent successes in genome editing in microalgae, we emphasize prospects for speeding up the strain incentive programme.

Increased fire activity in South America is one of the most concerning of all the recent events, given the potential impacts on local ecosystems and the global climate from the loss of large carbon stores under future socio-environmental change. However, due to the complexity of interactions and feedbacks, and lack of complete representation of fire biogeochemistry in many climate models, there is currently low agreement on whether climate change will cause fires to become more or less frequent in the future, and what impact this will have on ecosystems. Here we use the latest climate simulations from the UK Earth System Model UKESM1 to understand feedbacks in fire, dynamic vegetation, and terrestrial carbon stores using the JULES land surface model, taking into account future scenarios of change in emissions and land use. Based on evaluation of model performance for the present day, we address the specific policy-relevant question: how much fire-induced carbon loss will there be over South America at different global warming levels in the future? We find that burned area and fire emissions are projected to increase in the future due to hotter and drier conditions, which leads to large reductions in carbon storage, especially when combined with increasing land-use conversion. The model simulates a 30\\% loss of carbon at 4°C under the highest emission scenario, which could be reduced to 7\\% if temperature rise is limited to 1.5°C. Our results provide a critical assessment of ecosystem resilience under future climate change, and could inform the way fire and land-use is managed in the future to reduce the most deleterious impacts of climate change.",

Rice flowering stage is the most sensitive period to high temperatures, and therefore, the key for heat stress happening is the flowering stage coinciding with high temperature, which causes spikelet fertility decreasing in heat-sensitive varieties, and is the major factor for heat injury differences among various rice planting regions. With the development of rice breeding, temperature indexes for heat stress has been converted from daily maximum temperature of 35°C to 38°C with the stress duration of more than 3 d. During the flowering stage, anther dehiscence inhibition and low pollen shedding onto the stigma are two main reasons for spikelet fertility reduction under high temperatures. At panicle initiation stage, high temperatures aggravate spikelet degeneration, and destroy floral organ development. Various types of rice varieties coexist in production, and indica-japonica hybrid rice demonstrates the highest heat resistance in general, followed by indica and japonica rice varieties. In production, avoiding high temperature is the main strategy of preventing heat stress, and planting suitable cultivars and adjustment of sowing date are the most effective measures. Irrigation is an effective real-time cultivation measure to decline the canopy temperature during the rice flowering stage. We suggested that further study should be focused on exploring heat injury differences among different rice variety types, and innovating rice-planting methods according to planting system changes in rice planting regions with extreme heat stress. Meanwhile, high temperature monitor and warning systems should be improved to achieve optimal heat stress management efficiencies.",

         "abstract": "This paper provides a quantitative assessment of large-scale features in a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of Met Office Unified Model HadGEM-GC3.05 in coupled global historical and future simulations. The main motivation for the simulations is to provide a major component of the UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18), but they will also be used to make worldwide projections and inform future model development. Initially, a 25-member PPE, with 25 different parameter combinations, was simulated. Five members were subsequently dropped because either their simulated climate was unrealistically cool by 1970 or they suffered from numerical instabilities. The remaining 20 members were evaluated after completing the historical phase (1900--2005) against 13 separately selected Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, and five more members were dropped. The final product is a combined projection system of 15 PPE members and 13 CMIP5 models, which has a number of benefits. In particular, the range of outcomes available from the combined set of 28 is often larger than from either of the two constituent ensembles, thus providing users with a more complete picture of plausible impacts. Here we mainly describe the evaluation process of the 20 PPE members. We evaluate biases in a number of important properties of the global coupled system, including assessment of climatological averages, coupled modes of internal variability and historical and future changes. The parameter combinations yielded plausible yet diverse atmosphere and ocean model behaviours. The range of global temperature changes is narrow, largely driven by use of different CO2 pathways. The range of global warming is seemingly not linked to range of feedbacks estimated from atmosphere-only runs, though we caution that the range of the latter is narrow relative to CMIP5, and therefore this result is not unexpected. This is the second of two papers describing the generation of the PPE for UKCP18 projections. Part 1 (Sexton et al. 2021) describes the selection of 25 parameter combinations of 47 atmosphere and land surface parameters, using a set of cheap atmosphere-only runs at a coarser resolution from nearly 3000 samples of parameter space.",

We evaluated 6 years (2007\u20132012) of flux\u2010derived GPP data from the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment, situated in a grassland in Wyoming, USA. The GPP data were used to calibrate a light response model whose basic formulation has been successfully used in a variety of ecosystems. The model was extended by modeling maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax) and light\u2010use efficiency (Q) as functions of soil water, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, vegetation greenness, and nitrogen at current and antecedent (past) timescales. The model fits the observed GPP well (R2 = 0.79), which was confirmed by other model performance checks that compared different variants of the model (e.g. with and without antecedent effects). Stimulation of cumulative 6\u2010year GPP by warming (29%, P = 0.02) and eCO2 (26%, P = 0.07) was primarily driven by enhanced C uptake during spring (129%, P = 0.001) and fall (124%, P = 0.001), respectively, which was consistent across years. Antecedent air temperature (Tairant) and vapor pressure deficit (VPDant) effects on Amax (over the past 3\u20134 days and 1\u20133 days, respectively) were the most significant predictors of temporal variability in GPP among most treatments. The importance of VPDant suggests that atmospheric drought is important for predicting GPP under current and future climate; we highlight the need for experimental studies to identify the mechanisms underlying such antecedent effects. Finally, posterior estimates of cumulative GPP under control and eCO2 treatments were tested as a benchmark against 12 terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). The narrow uncertainties of these data\u2010driven GPP estimates suggest that they could be useful semi\u2010independent data streams for validating TBMs",

Understanding potential changes of cyclone frequency and intensity is thus essential for a proper assessment of climate change impacts. Here the behavior of extratropical cyclones under strongly varying climate conditions is investigated using idealized climate model simulations in an aquaplanet setup. A cyclone tracking algorithm is applied to assess various statistics of cyclone properties such as intensity, size, lifetime, displacement velocity, and deepening rates. In addition, a composite analysis of intense cyclones is performed. In general, the structure of extratropical cyclones in the idealized simulations is very robust, and changes in major cyclone characteristics are relatively small. Median cyclone intensity, measured in terms of minimum sea level pressure and lower-tropospheric relative vorticity, has a maximum in simulations with global mean temperature slightly warmer than present-day Earth, broadly consistent with the behavior of the eddy kinetic energy analyzed in previous studies. Maximum deepening rates along cyclone tracks behave similarly and are in agreement with linear quasigeostrophic growth rates if the effect of latent heat release on the stratification is taken into account. In contrast to moderate cyclones, the relative vorticity of intense cyclones continues to increase with warming to substantially higher temperatures, and this is associated with enhanced lower-tropospheric potential vorticity anomalies likely caused by increased diabatic heating. Moist processes may, therefore, lead to the further strengthening of intense cyclones in warmer climates even if cyclones weaken on average.",

This omission has consequences for ground thermal and moisture regimes, particularly in the high-latitudes where soil carbon content is generally high. Global soil carbon data is used to build a geographically distributed, profiled soil carbon density dataset for the Community Land Model (CLM). CLM parameterizations for soil thermal and hydraulic properties are modified to accommodate both mineral and organic soil matter. Offline simulations including organic soil are characterized by cooler annual mean soil temperatures (up to ∼2.5°C cooler for regions of high soil carbon content). Cooling is strong in summer due to modulation of early and mid-summer soil heat flux. Winter temperatures are slightly warmer as organic soils do not cool as efficiently during fall and winter. High porosity and hydraulic conductivity of organic soil leads to a wetter soil column but with comparatively low surface layer saturation levels and correspondingly low soil evaporation. When CLM is coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model, the reduced latent heat flux drives deeper boundary layers, associated reductions in low cloud fraction, and warmer summer air temperatures in the Arctic. Lastly, the insulative properties of organic soil reduce interannual soil temperature variability, but only marginally. This result suggests that, although the mean soil temperature cooling will delay the simulated date at which frozen soil begins to thaw, organic matter may provide only limited insulation from surface warming.",

Together with 13 CMIP5 simulations, this PPE provides users with a dataset that samples modelling uncertainty and is ideal for use in impacts studies. Evaluations of global mean surface temperatures for this PPE have shown twenty-first century warming rates consistently at the top end of the CMIP5 range. Here we investigate one potential contributory factor to this lack of spread: that the methodology to select plausible members from a larger, related PPE of atmosphere-only experiments preferentially ruled out those predicted to have more negative climate feedbacks (i.e. lower climate sensitivities). We confirm that this is indeed the case. We show that performance in extratropical long-wave cloud forcing played a key role in this by constraining ice cloud parameters, which in turn constrained the feedback distribution (though causal links are not established). The relatively weak relationship driving this constraint is shown to arise from stronger relationships for the long-wave and short-wave cloud feedback components, which largely cancel out due to changes in tropical high clouds. Moreover, we show that the strength of these constraints is due to a structural bias in extratropical long-wave cloud forcing across the PPE. We discuss how choices made in the methodology to pick the plausible PPE members may result in an overly strong constraint when there is a structural bias and possible improvements to this methodology for the future.",

Here I review the evidence for these changes, their magnitude, their possible\n                        causes, their representation in climate models, and their potential implications for climate change. The various studies analyzing\n                        long-term records of surface radiation measurements suggest a widespread decrease in surface solar radiation between the 1950s\n                        and 1980s ( \u201D global dimming\u201D), with a partial recovery more recently at many locations ( \u201D brightening\u201D). There are also some\n                        indications for an  \u201D early brightening\u201D in the first part of the 20th century. These variations are in line with independent\n                        long-term observations of sunshine duration, diurnal temperature range, pan evaporation, and, more recently, satellite-derived\n                        estimates, which add credibility to the existence of these changes and their larger-scale significance. Current climate models,\n                        in general, tend to simulate these decadal variations to a much lesser degree. The origins of these variations are internal\n                        to the Earth's atmosphere and not externally forced by the Sun. Variations are not only found under cloudy but also under\n                        cloud-free atmospheres, indicative of an anthropogenic contribution through changes in aerosol emissions governed by economic\n                        developments and air pollution regulations. The relative importance of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions may\n                        differ depending on region and pollution level. Highlighted are further potential implications of dimming and brightening\n                        for climate change, which may affect global warming, the components and intensity of the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle,\n                        and the cryosphere among other climate elements.",

We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into consideration, a new mass ratio of CO2 sequestration per olivine dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20\\% smaller than previously assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid. In our calculations for the Amazon and Congo river catchments, a maximum annual dissolution of 1.8 and 0.4 Pg of olivine seems possible, corresponding to the sequestration of 0.5 and 0.1 Pg of C per year, but these upper limit sequestration rates come at the environmental cost of pH values in the rivers rising to 8.2. Open water dissolution of fine-grained olivine and an enhancement of the biological pump by the rising riverine input of silicic acid might increase our estimate of the carbon sequestration, but additional research is needed here. We finally calculate with a carbon cycle model the consequences of sequestration rates of 1\u20135 Pg of C per year for the 21st century by this technique.",

Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed \\~0.8oC over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0oC by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0-6.0oC by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Nino Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as bioclim consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5-1.0oC of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.",

Water is contaminated with different type of pollutants such as organic, inorganic, heavy metals, pesticides, dyes, phenols, and many other pollutants. Using adsorption phenomenon is very practical, easy and common method to remove pollutants from water. Owing to the significant properties of lignin such as high surface area, porosity, availability in huge amount, it was chosen to be used as an adsorbent surface of various pollutants. Herein it is going to review some of important literatures regarding that. Another serious problem that is threatening the marine eco-system, human health, and influence the global warming is the huge consumption of plastic polymers every year. Thus, reducing the consumption of plastic polymers is significantly matter. Lignin chemical structures are highly oxygenated and have several aromatic units, so by definition lignin can act as an antioxidant, free radical scavenger and photo-stabilizers. As the chemical structure of monomer moieties to form lignin are highly aromatic so it is suitable to work as UV- blocker to stop the photo-degradation of plastic",

Photoacoustic and reciprocal nephelometer measurements at 532 nm accomplished with a single instrument compare favorably with conventional measurements made with an aethalometer and a TSI nephelometer. The diurnally averaged single scattering albedo at 532 nm was found to vary from 0.60 to 0.85 with the peak value at midday and the minimum value at 07:00 a.m. local time, indicating that the Mexico City plume is likely to have a net warming effect on local climate. The peak value is associated with strong photochemical generation of secondary aerosol. It is estimated that the photochemical production of secondary aerosol (inorganic and organic) is approximately 75% of the aerosol mass concentration and light scattering in association with the peak single scattering albedo. A strong correlation of aerosol scattering at 532 nm and total aerosol mass concentration was found, and an average mass scattering efficiency factor of 3.8 m(2)/g was determined. Comparisons of photoacoustic and aethalometer light absorption with oxygenated organic aerosol concentration (OOA) indicate a very small systematic bias of the filter based measurement associated with OOA and the peak aerosol single scattering albedo.",

However, evolutionary game theory predicts that the temptation to forgo the public good mostly wins over collective cooperative action, and this is often also seen in economic experiments. Here we show how social diversity provides an escape from this apparent paradox. Up to now, individuals have been treated as equivalent in all respects, in sharp contrast with real-life situations, where diversity is ubiquitous. We introduce social diversity by means of heterogeneous graphs and show that cooperation is promoted by the diversity associated with the number and size of the public goods game in which each individual participates and with the individual contribution to each such game. When social ties follow a scale-free distribution9, cooperation is enhanced whenever all individuals are expected to contribute a fixed amount irrespective of the plethora of public goods games in which they engage. Our results may help to explain the emergence of cooperation in the absence of mechanisms based on individual reputation and punishment. Combining social diversity with reputation and punishment will provide instrumental clues on the self-organization of social communities and their economical implications.",

Ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect, global climate change and global warming are among the rising environmental concerns. The increasing number of environmentally conscious consumers has resulted in numerous Go Green campaigns and a Go Green movement, along with solutions and calls for consumers, corporations and governments to be more proactive in going green in every aspect. Libraries are no exception. Although it is so important, little is known about the green-library concept in the African context and among Kenyan libraries. Like some other developing countries, Kenya has responded to climate change in various ways because of its adverse impacts. It is important to explore how libraries are planning for a sustainable future. Subsequently, this study aimed to explore the adoption of green-library concepts in Kenya for environmental sustainability with a view to proposing strategies that can be used to guide libraries in going green. The study adopted a qualitative approach. A sample of 12 libraries was purposively drawn from a population of 227 academic, public and special libraries in Kenya. Data was collected using semi-structured interview schedules complemented by observation and a document review, and analysed using grounded theory. The findings show that libraries in Kenya, under their umbrella organizations, have taken advantage of their knowledge of green concepts through adopting and implementing green practices and coming up with strategies to enhance green libraries and promote environmental sustainability. They have done this mainly through redesigning and renovating to meet ever-changing user demands in line with green-library standards. The study concludes that librarians in Kenyan libraries understand green-building concepts and have adopted different green initiatives, albeit partially to reposition and maintain their position globally. The study proposes three strategies for fully going green: active user involvement in green initiatives; improving performance and growth measuring metrics; and maintaining green-library standards in accordance with the IFLA's Environment, Sustainability and Libraries Section (ENSULIB) green-library checklist.",

Important terms that can be constrained using only measurements and radiative transfer models are ocean heat content, radiative forcing by long-lived trace gases, and radiative forcing from volcanic eruptions. We explicitly consider the emission of energy by a warming Earth by using correlations between surface temperature and satellite radiant flux data and show that this term is already quite significant. About 20% of the integrated positive forcing by greenhouse gases and solar radiation since 1950 has been radiated to space. Only about 10% of the positive forcing (about 1/3 of the net forcing) has gone into heating the Earth, almost all into the oceans. About 20% of the positive forcing has been balanced by volcanic aerosols, and the remaining 50% is mainly attributable to tropospheric aerosols. After accounting for the measured terms, the residual forcing between 1970 and 2000 due to direct and indirect forcing by aerosols as well as semidirect forcing from greenhouse gases and any unknown mechanism can be estimated as -1.1 +/- 0.4 W m(-2) (1 sigma). This is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's best estimates but rules out very large negative forcings from aerosol indirect effects. Further, the data imply an increase from the 1950s to the 1980s followed by constant or slightly declining aerosol forcing into the 1990s, consistent with estimates of trends in global sulfate emissions. An apparent increase in residual forcing in the late 1990s is discussed.",

In this paper, a statistical method called partial-least square (PLS) regression is utilized to uncover principal sea surface temperature (SST) modes in the winter preceding the EASM. Results show that the SST pattern of the first PLS mode is associated with the turnabout of warming (or cooling) phase of a mega-El Niño/Southern Oscillation (mega-ENSO) (a leading mode of interannual-to-interdecadal variations of global SST), whereas that of the second PLS mode leads the warming/cooling mega-ENSO by about 1 year, signaling precursory conditions for mega-ENSO. These indicate that mega-ENSO may provide a critical predictability source for the EASM strength. Based on a 40-year training period (1958\u20131997), a PLS prediction model is constructed using the two leading PLS modes and 3-month-lead hindcasts are performed for the validation period of 1998\u20132013. A promising skill is obtained, which is comparable to the ensemble mean of versions 3 and 4 of the Canadian Community Atmosphere Model (CanCM3/4) hindcasts from the newly developed North American Multi-model Ensemble Prediction System regarding the interannual variations of the EASM strength. How to improve dynamical model simulation of the EASM is also examined through comparing the CanCM3/4 hindcast (1982\u20132010) with the 106-year historical run (1900\u20132005) by the Second Generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2). CanCM3/4 exhibits a high skill in the EASM hindcast period 1982\u20132010 during which it also has a better performance in capturing the relationship between the EASM and mega-ENSO. By contrast, the simulation skill of CanESM2 is quite low and it is unable to reproduce the linkage between the EASM and mega-ENSO. All these results emphasize importance of mega-ENSO in seasonal prediction and dynamical model simulation of the EASM.",

We hypothesized that the interdecadal changes linearly consisted of two independent components, anthropogenic forcing and natural decadal variability, which can be represented simply by the radiative forcing effect of carbon dioxide (RFCO2) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), respectively. The combined effect of the RFCO2 and PDO could explain the majority of the surface temperature changes during the late 1970s and 1990s, but the magnitudes of the relative contribution of the RFCO2 and the PDO are inconsistent in different regions. For both the surface temperature and geopotential height, the RFCO2 could induce significantly positive anomalies over almost the entire globe for these two shifts, exhibiting a larger magnitude in the mid\u2013high latitudes and in the late 1990s shift. The PDO could induce opposite anomalies for the two interdecadal shifts due to its phase transitions (negative-positive\u2013negative). Furthermore, for the shift in the late 1970s, both the RFCO2 (53.7\\%\u201366.7\\%) and the PDO (33.3\\%\u201346.3\\%) were important in regulating the tropical geopotential height, whereas the RFCO2 dominated the changes in the mid-latitudes. For the western Pacific subtropical high, the RFCO2 (PDO) could explain 52.3\\%\u201362.1\\% (37.9\\%\u201347.7\\%) of the change. The negative effect of the PDO counteracted most of the RFCO2 effects for the late 1990s shift.",

         "abstract": "Global climate has been warming rapidly since the beginning of the 20th century due to the emission of green house gases, inevitably altering the character of local and regional climate systems in the world, particularly the western parts of Africa. The main objective of this study is to analyse trends in 5 precipitation indices, based on daily data from 31 meteorological data stations. The 31 stations from which data was analysed in this study were from Togo, Benin, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Central African Republic and Congo for the time range of 1950-1980. RClimdex software was used to process the magnitude of precipitation while the trend was determined using Mann-Kendalls test at (90%) p < 0.1 significance level. 93% of stations studied showed negative(decreasing) rainfall trends for precipitation total(PRCPTOT), 95th percentile(R95P) and 99th percentile(R99P) rainfall showed 67% and 61.29% of stations with negative trends of precipitation respectively, consecutive dry days(CDD) was positive(increasing) in 61.29% of stations while consecutive wet days(CWD) was negative (decreasing) in 67.74% of the 31 stations. This study shows that the magnitudes of the precipitation was predominantly negative(decreasing) rainfall trends from 1950-1980 in most of the stations, thereby indicating an evidence of coupling effects of a warmer climate and regional precipitation. These precipitation negative trends and magnitude has various effects on society and ecosystems within the scope of climate change in Western Africa.",

         "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is projected to lead to a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). One of the mechanisms contributing to this is ice melt leading to a freshening of the North Atlantic Ocean. We use two global climate models to investigate the role of temperature and salinity in the weakening of the AMOC resulting from freshwater forcing. This study finds that freshwater hosing reduces the strength of the AMOC, but in some situations it is not through reduced density from freshening, but a reduction in density from subsurface warming. When the freshwater is mixed down it directly reduces the density of the North Atlantic, weakening the strength of the AMOC. As the AMOC weakens, the mixed layer depth reduces and surface properties are less effectively mixed down. A buoyant surface cap forms, blocking atmospheric fluxes. This leads to the development of a warm anomaly beneath the surface cap, which becomes the primary driver of AMOC weakening. We found that the mean North Atlantic salinity anomaly can be used as a proxy for AMOC weakening because it describes the extent of this surface cap.",

Based on the milestone literature on the research field of renewable and non-renewable energies, forest biomass and bioenergy have significant compatibility with both industry and nature. Through this, our proposal contributes to supply one of the most available clean energy sources and direct this type of energy needed in an optimal way. The essential resilience components are determined and classified according to the theoretical and practical concepts. Then, this research is made use of a conceptual decision-making model based on third order confirmatory factor analysis to explore the interactions among the components in form of a network. The results reveal that the proposed model has sufficient validity and reliability levels. Finally, key interactions among the elements of model that contributed to most of the impacts on the forest biomass and bioenergy supply chain resilience were found to be optimized constantly within the network.",

Previous studies pointed out that consumers of conspiracy-like content are likely to aggregate in homophile clusters\u2014i.e., echo-chambers. Along this path we study, by means of a thorough quantitative analysis, how different topics are consumed inside the conspiracy echo-chamber in the Italian Facebook. Through a semi-automatic topic extraction strategy, we show that the most consumed contents semantically refer to four specific categories: environment, diet, health, and geopolitics. We find similar consumption patterns by comparing users activity (likes and comments) on posts belonging to these different semantic categories. Finally, we model users mobility across the distinct topics finding that the more a user is active, the more he is likely to span on all categories. Once inside a conspiracy narrative users tend to embrace the overall corpus.",

A significant percentage of the\r\nrequired capacity increase can be based on renewable energy sources.The integration of\r\nDistributed Generations into grid has a great importance in improving system reliability.\r\nThe power generation with renewable energy sources is essential in now-a-days to control\r\nthe atmospheric pollution and global warming. To get fast tracking for maximum power, it\r\nis preferable to use incremental conductance method. MPPT control for variable speed\r\nwind turbine is driven by Induction Generator. The wind turbine generator is operated\r\nsuch that the rotor speed varies according to wind speed to adjust the duty cycle of power\r\ninverter and maximizes wind energy conversion system efficiency. The system includes the\r\nwind turbine, induction generator, three phase rectifier, DC link voltage controller, three\r\nphase inverter. In this paper, modeling and simulation of wind energy conversion system\r\n(WECS) with incremental conductance maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is\r\npresented. This WECS is connected to electric utility to measure the performance. In this\r\npaper, the objective such as optimal location and sizing of DG units are studied to check the\r\nsystem performance in reducing the power losses, increase in voltage profile and reliability.\r\nFor analyzing the performance of WECS, a case study is carried out on IEEE 15 bus radial\r\ndistribution system. The case studies shows that there is gradual improvement in voltage\r\nprofile, reduction in power losses and variation in reliability indices and results were\r\nsimulated in the MATLAB/SIMULINK.

Both are strongly inﬂuenced by the ampliﬁed Arctic warming and essential variables to understand environmental changes and their dynamics. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series for monitoring SC depletion and snowmelt with high spatiotemporal resolution to capture their understudied small-scale heterogeneity. We use 97 dual-polarized S-1 SAR images acquired over northeastern Greenland and 94 over southwestern Greenland in the interferometric wide swath mode from the years 2017 and 2018. Comparison of S-1 intensity against SC fraction maps derived from orthorectiﬁed terrestrial time-lapse imagery indicates that SAR backscatter can increase before a decrease in SC fraction is observed. Hence, the increase in backscatter is related to changing snowpack properties during the runoff phase as well as decreasing SC fraction. We here present a novel empirical approach based on the temporal evolution of the SAR signal to identify start of runoff (SOR), end of snow cover (EOS) and SC extent for each S-1 observation date during melt using backscatter thresholds as well as the derivative. Comparison of SC with orthorectified time-lapse imagery indicates that HV polarization outperforms HH when using a global threshold. The derivative avoids manual selection of thresholds and adapts to different environmental settings and seasonal conditions. With a global configuration (threshold: 4\u2009dB; polarization: HV) as well as with the derivative, the overall accuracy of SC maps was in all cases above 75\u2009\\% and in more than half of cases above 90\u2009\\%. Based on the physical principle of SAR backscatter during snowmelt, our approach is expected to work well in other low-vegetation areas and, hence, could support large-scale SC monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution (20\u2009m, 6\u2009d) with high accuracy.",

Using Artemov's natural semantics for justification logic\r\nJL, in which justifications are interpreted as sets of formulas, we provide an\r\ninductive construction of models of DL, and prove soundness and completeness\r\nresults for DL. Some logical notions developed for JL, such as constant\r\nspecifications and the internalization property, are inconsistent with DL. This\r\nleads us to define negative constant specifications for DL, which can be used\r\nto model agents with justified false beliefs. Denial logic can therefore be\r\nrelevant to philosophical skepticism. We use DL with what we call coherent\r\nnegative constant specifications to model a Putnamian brain in a vat with the\r\njustified false belief that it is not a brain in a vat, and derive a model of\r\nJL in which \"I am a brain in a vat\" is false. We define the fusion of Denial\r\nLogic with the Logic of Proofs to model an agent who can justify and check\r\ntautologies and who can believe his justified false beliefs.

It covers the basics in thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, radiation, and chemistry and explains the most intriguing problems that currently exist in the study of the atmospheres of the Earth and planets. A particular effort is made to approach the different topics intuitively. Among the themes covered are the most recent evolution concerning the chemistry of polluted troposphere, the global warming problem, and chaos and non linear theory.\n\nThe book is almost completely rewritten in comparison to the previous edition, with a more logical organization of the chapters. The fundamentals of thermodynamics, radiation, fluid dynamics and chemistry are introduced in the first six chapters including a new chapter on remote sensing. Also there is an additional chapter on Geoengineering. A significant addition to the new edition, at the end of each chapter, are the Examples where the topics introduced in the chapter are further discussed with application to classical problems or new research items. Many of these examples are accompanied by computer programs. The most important update deals with the theory of the general circulation, the methods to evaluate GCM, the detailed discussion of the urban troposphere and the chaos and non linear phenomena.",

Apart from its impact on global warming, the annually increasing atmospheric CO2 is of interest to plant scientists primarily because of its direct influence on photosynthesis and photorespiration in C3 species. But in addition, 'dark' respiration, another major component of the carbon budget of higher plants, may be affected by a change in CO2 independent of an increase in temperature. Literature pertaining to an impact of CO2 on respiration rate is reviewed. With an increase in CO2, respiration rate is increased in some cases, but decreased in others. The effects of CO2 on respiration rate may be direct or indirect. Mechanisms responsible for various observations are proposed. These proposed mechanisms relate to changes in: (1) levels of nonstructural carbohydrates, (2) growth rate and structural phytomass accumulation, (3) composition of phytomass, (4) direct chemical interactions between CO2 and respiratory enzymes, (5) direct chemical interactions between CO2 and other cellular components, (6) dark CO2 fixation rate, and (7) ethylene biosynthesis rate. Because a range-of (possibly interactive) effects exist, and present knowledge is limited, the impact of future CO2 on respiration rate cannot be predicted. Theoretical considerations and types of experiments that can lead to an increase in the understanding of this issue are outlined.",

These two factors are almost always confounded because saturated vapor pressure increases exponentially with temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) could have a large impact on plant growth. In this study using climate controlled mini-greenhouses, we examined the interacting influence of temperature and VPD on long-term growth of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb), a cool season grass. From past studies it was expected that growth of tall fescue would decline with warmer temperatures over the range of 18.5\u201327�C, but growth actually increased markedly with increasing temperature when VPD was held constant. In contrast, growth declined in experiments where tall fescue was exposed to increasing VPD and temperature was held constant at 21�C. The inhibited growth appears to be in response to a maximum transpiration rate that can be supported by the tall fescue plants. The sensitivity to VPD indicates that if VPD remains stable in future climates as it has in the past, growth of tall fescue could well be stimulated rather than decreased by global warming in temperate climate zones.",

The ØRC\\ prevents the stagnation of the solar loop and reverses the heat pump cycle. The working fluid is evaporated in the condenser of the heat pump, expanded in the scroll compressor, which becomes a scroll expander, and condensed in the brine heat exchanger. The only additional investments for the ØRC\\ system comprise a pump, valves and upgraded controls and are estimated to be 400 \u20AC for a single-family-house unit. Flat-plate collectors are the preferred collector type as the higher collector efficiency of evacuated tube collectors does not outweigh the higher costs. The thermal recharging of the ground during ØRC\\ has a negligible impact on the \\COP\\ of the heat pump. However, the recharging leads to less deep boreholes compared to a conventional system. Because of the low investments for the ORC, even small reductions in borehole depth make a significant contribution to the economic feasibility of the system. The addition of the ØRC\\ overall generates a small profit of 155 \u20AC at Ankara and 74 \u20AC at Denver for a rocky soil and a thermally enhanced grout. On the contrary, the conventional solar combisystem coupled to a ground source heat pump was found to be economically unreasonable at all locations. The working fluid isobutane is interesting for future applications because of the lower global warming potential and the smaller saturation pressures compared to R134a. The latter allow for the installation of a mass-produced rotary vane pump reducing the additional investments for the ØRC\\ to 200 \u20AC. This way the ØRC\\ becomes reasonable at all locations with profits of 505 \u20AC at Ankara, 375 \u20AC at Denver and 189 \u20AC at Bochum.",

To this end, we compared the photosynthetic responses of two C4 grasses (Panicum coloratum and Cenchrus ciliaris) and one C4 dicot (Flaveria bidentis) to growth at moderate (25/20 °C, day/night) or high (35/30 °C, day/night) temperatures. In all three C4 species, CO2 assimilation rates (A) underwent significant thermal acclimation, such that when compared at growth temperatures, A increased less than what would be expected given the strong response of A to short-term changes in leaf temperature. Thermal photosynthetic acclimation was further manifested by an increase in the temperature optima of A, and a decrease in leaf nitrogen content and leaf mass per area in the high- relative to the moderate-temperature-grown plants. Reduced photosynthetic capacity at the higher growth temperature was underpinned by selective changes in photosynthetic components. Plants grown at the higher temperature had lower amounts of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and cytochrome f and activity of carbonic anhydrase. The activities of photosystem II (PSII) and phosphenolpyruvate carboxylase were not affected by growth temperature. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of F. bidentis showed a corresponding decrease in the quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) and an increase in non-photochemical quenching (ΦNPQ). It is concluded that through these biochemical changes, C4 plants maintain the balance between the various photosynthetic components at each growth temperature, despite the differing temperature dependence of each process. As such, at higher temperatures photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency increases more than A. Our results suggest C4 plants will show only modest changes in photosynthetic rates in response to changes in growth temperature, such as those expected within or between seasons, or the warming anticipated as a result of global climate change.",

         "abstract": "Global climate has been warming rapidly since the beginning of the 20th century due to the emission of green house gases, inevitably altering the character of local and regional climate systems in the world, particularly the western parts of Africa. The main objective of this study is to analyse trends in 5 precipitation indices, based on daily data from 31 meteorological data stations. The 31 stations from which data was analysed in this study were from Togo, Benin, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Central African Republic and Congo for the time range of 1950-1980. RClimdex software was used to process the magnitude of precipitation while the trend was determined using Mann-Kendalls test at (90%) p < 0.1 significance level. 93% of stations studied showed negative(decreasing) rainfall trends for precipitation total(PRCPTOT), 95th percentile(R95P) and 99th percentile(R99P) rainfall showed 67% and 61.29% of stations with negative trends of precipitation respectively, consecutive dry days(CDD) was positive(increasing) in 61.29% of stations while consecutive wet days(CWD) was negative (decreasing) in 67.74% of the 31 stations. This study shows that the magnitudes of the precipitation was predominantly negative(decreasing) rainfall trends from 1950-1980 in most of the stations, thereby indicating an evidence of coupling effects of a warmer climate and regional precipitation. These precipitation negative trends and magnitude has various effects on society and ecosystems within the scope of climate change in Western Africa.",

One of the alternatives to the damage caused is, in addition to reducing their emission, their sequestration by ecosystems. The general objective of this study was to estimate the biomass and the amount of carbon sequestered by woody plants in the different biotopes in the classified forest of Yapo-Abbé. Surface surveys and statistical analyses performed on the dendrometric parameters have shown that this forest stores a biomass estimated at 22.26 t/ha for a sequestration of 10.45 t/ha of carbon. Most of this gas is sequestered by the Yapo block, especially by its secondary forest biotope. The least anthropized and least disturbed environments have a greater storage capacity. The amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered by the classified forest of Yapo-Abbé is on average 39.53 t/ha of atmospheric carbon, or 1,201,988.71 t/ha of CO2 sequestered. This study testifies to the importance of the conservation of forests in Côte d'Ivoire and their importance in the process of reducing greenhouse gases in the troposphere, thus reducing global warming.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Carbon stock, Sequestrated, Woody species, Yapo-Abbé classified forest",

These demographic changes often have drastic population genetic effects, such as a stochastic resampling of the gene pool through the \u201Csurfing\u201D phenomenon. Most models assume that the speed of range expansions is only limited by the dispersal ability of the colonizing species and its reproductive potential. While such models of \u201Cphenotype-limited\u201D expansions apply to species invasions, it is clear that many range expansions are limited rather by the slow motion of habitat boundaries, as driven for instance by global warming. Here, we develop a coalescent model to study the genetic impact of such \u201Cboundary-limited\u201D range expansions. Our simulations and analysis show that the resulting loss of genetic diversity is markedly lower than in species invasions if large carrying capacities can be maintained up to the habitat frontier. Counterintuitively, we find that the total loss of diversity does not depend on the speed of the range expansion: Slower expansions have a smaller rate of loss, but also last longer. Boundary-limited range expansions exhibit a characteristic genetic footprint and should therefore be distinguished from range expansions limited only by intrinsic characteristics of the species.",

Most of the inferences using temporal information have been derived from a malaria incidence time series from Kericho. Here, we report a detailed analysis of 5 monthly time series, between 15 and 41 years long, from West Kenya encompassing an altitudinal gradient along Lake Victoria basin. We found decreasing, but heterogeneous, malaria trends since the late 1980s at low altitudes (<1600 m), and the early 2000s at high altitudes (>1600 m). Regime shifts were present in 3 of the series and were synchronous in the 2 time series from high altitudes. At low altitude, regime shifts were associated with a shift from increasing to decreasing malaria transmission, as well as a decrease in variability. At higher altitudes, regime shifts reflected an increase in malaria transmission variability. The heterogeneity in malaria trends probably reflects the multitude of factors that can drive malaria transmission and highlights the need for both spatially and temporally fine-grained data to make sound inferences about the impacts of climate change and control/elimination interventions on malaria transmission.",

An overview of the various radiative feedbacks diagnosed from the reference EC-Earth configuration is documented for the first time. The cloud feedback is positive and small. While the total feedback parameter is almost insensitive to model configuration, the cloud feedback, in particular its shortwave (SW) component, can vary considerably depending on the model settings. The lateral mass exchange rate of penetrative convection and the conversion rate from condensed water to precipitation are leading uncertain parameters affecting the radiative feedbacks diagnosed. Consistent with other studies, we find a strong correlation between low-cloud model fidelity and low-cloud response under global warming. It is shown that this relationship holds only for stratocumulus regimes and is contributed by low-cloud cover, rather than low-cloud optical thickness. Model configurations simulating higher stratocumulus cover, that is closer to the observations, exhibit a stronger positive SW cloud feedback. This feedback is likely underestimated in the reference EC-Earth configuration, over the eastern basins of the tropical oceans. In addition, connections between simulated high-cloud top altitude in present-day climate and longwave cloud feedback are discussed.",

The methodology of discourse analysis has been applied to investigate the changing perceptions of climate change over time and the ways in which it became an important issue on Germany's political agenda. The first part of the paper will briefly introduce the underlying theoretical assumptions and explain the multiple steps by which data covering a period of two decades have been collected and analyzed. In the second part, the paper will provide the reader with the main research results, indicating the usefulness of distinguishing among the separate discourses on climate change in science, politics, and the mass media. The results suggest that there are specific discourse dynamics common to each of the three spheres, as well as some important disparities among them. These findings will be illustrated by a selection of examples typical of the samples analyzed. Finally, the third part of the paper will discuss the broader theoretical and practical implications of these results, which suggest that modern societies must cope not only with environmental risks but also with the risks inherent in communication.",

Studies on the effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still lacking and current knowledge is provided by epidemiological and experimental studies on the relationship between asthma and environmental factors, such as meteorological variables, airborne allergens and air pollution. However, there is also considerable evidence that subjects affected by asthma are at an increased risk of developing obstructive airway exacerbations with exposure to gaseous and particulate components of air pollution. It is not easy to evaluate the impact of climate change and air pollution on the prevalence of asthma in general and on the timing of asthma exacerbations. However, the global rise in asthma prevalence and severity suggests that air pollution and climate changes could be contributing. Pollen allergy is frequently used to study the interrelationship between air pollution, rhinitis and bronchial asthma. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that urbanization, high levels of vehicle emissions and westernized lifestyle are correlated to an increase in the frequency of pollen-induced respiratory allergy, prevalent in people who live in urban areas compared with those who live in rural areas. Meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.) along with their climatological regimes (warm or cold anomalies and dry or wet periods, etc.), can affect both biological and chemical components of this interaction. In addition, by inducing airway inflammation, air pollution overcomes the mucosal barrier priming allergen-induced responses. In conclusion, climate change might induce negative effects on respiratory allergic diseases. In particular, the increased length and severity of the pollen season, the higher occurrence of heavy precipitation events and the increasing frequency of urban air pollution episodes suggest that environmental risk factors will have a stronger effect in the following decades.",

In this paper, inspired by the terrible weather on the way here to Oldtown, I attempt to understand and explain this fascinating and mysterious climate. I start by presenting observational evidence from various ancient manuscripts from the Citadel Library, and then, with the aid of a Climate Model, present a theory for the changing seasons based on variations in the orbit of the planet around the Sun. I then explore the implications of this theory for phenomena such as the likely attack plans of invading dragon hordes from Essos, the dominance of the seas by the Iron Fleet, the hibernation zones of White Walkers in summer, and the trading routes between Westeros and the Free cities across the Narrow Sea. Following this, I compare the climate of various regions in the world of Game of Thrones with those of the 'real' Earth, and show that the climate of The Wall in winter resembles very closely that of Lapland in Sweden/Finland, and Fairbanks, Alaska, whereas the climate of Casterly Rock, home of the scheming Lannisters, resembles that of Changsha in China, and Houston, Texas. Finally, I make a prediction of the  \u201D Climate Sensitivity\u201D of the world of Game of Thrones, the amount of global warming that would occur if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were to be doubled (due to the recent increase in carbon dioxide and methane emissions from dragons, and the excessive use of wildfire). I show that this warming would likely be accompanied by sea level rise that could lead to the inundation of coastal cities, including the outskirts of King's Landing (which may be a good thing... unless you are unfortunate enough to live there).",

This helps to make the future construction eco friendly and also reduce the emission of CO2. Now a days global warming is the major drawback of whole world which is directly or indirectly caused by the civil engineering field. The world consumes concrete more next to water. So it is the duty of every civil engineer to go along the disadvantages of green house gas emission and to reduce their effects in environment. This can be sought by using the eco friendly materials and also the eco friendly waste concrete available in earth. This journal paper would provide the ideas of green construction and also helps to induce the engineers choice of construction.

Three policy options are modeled: (1) a charge per unit of life cycle CO2 emissions, (2)~a charge per unit of direct biorefinery emissions only, and (3) a low carbon fuel standard (LCFS). A CO2 charge on life cycle emissions increases production costs by between $0.005 and $0.008~l?1 per $10~Mg?1~CO2 price increment, across all modeled plant energy systems, with increases under direct emissions somewhat lower in all cases. In contrast, a LCFS increases the cost of production for selected plant energy systems only: a LCFS requiring reductions in average fuel global warming intensity (GWI) with a target of 10\\% below the 2005 baseline increases the production costs for coal-fired plants only. For all other plant types, the LCFS operates as a subsidy. The findings depend strongly on the magnitude of a land use change adder. Some land use change adders currently discussed in the literature will push the GWI of all modeled production systems above the LCFS target, flipping the CO2 price from a subsidy to a tax.",

We conducted an experiment to evaluate the impacts of global warming on the phenology and yield of two determinate soybean cultivars in a temperate region (37.27°N, 126.99°E; Suwon, South Korea). These two soybean cultivars, Sinpaldalkong maturity group (MG) IV and Daewonkong (MG VI), were cultured on various sowing dates within a four-year period, under no water-stress conditions. Soybeans were kept in greenhouses controlled at the current ambient temperature (AT), AT+1.5°C, AT+3.0°C, and AT+5.0°C throughout the growth periods. Growth periods (VE\u2013R7) were significantly prolonged by the elevated temperatures, especially the R1\u2013R5 period. Cultivars exhibited no significant differences in seed yield at the AT+1.5°C and AT+3.0°C treatments, compared to AT, while a significant yield reduction was observed at the AT+5.0°C treatment. Yield reductions resulted from limited seed number, which was due to an overall low numbers of pods and seeds per pod. Heat stress conditions induced a decrease in pod number to a greater degree than in seed number per pod. Individual seed weight exhibited no significant variation among temperature elevation treatments; thus, seed weight likely had negligible impacts on overall seed yield. A boundary line analysis (using quantile regression) estimated optimum temperatures for seed number at 26.4 to 26.8°C (VE\u2013R5) for both cultivars; the optimum temperatures (R5\u2013R7) for single seed weight were estimated at 25.2°C for the Sinpaldalkong smaller-seeded cultivar, and at 22.3°C for the Daewonkong larger-seeded cultivar. The optimum growing season (VE\u2013R7) temperatures for seed yield, which were estimated by combining the two boundary lines for seed number and seed weight, were 26.4 and 25.0°C for the Sinpaldalkong and Daewonkong cultivars, respectively. Considering the current soybean growing season temperature, which ranges from 21.7 (in the north) to 24.6°C (in the south) in South Korea, and the temperature response of potential soybean yields, further warming of less than approximately 1°C would not become a critical limiting factor for soybean production in South Korea.",

The results show that this strong El Niño event fully established in spring 2015 and has been rapidly developing into one of the three strongest El Niño episodes in recorded history. Meanwhile, it is also expected to be the longest event recorded, attributable to the stable maintenance of the abnormally warm conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean since spring 2014. Owing to the impacts of this strong event, along with climate warming background, the global surface temperature and the surface air temperature over Chinese mainland reached record highs in 2015. Disastrous weather in various places worldwide have occurred in association with this severe El Niño episode, and summer precipitation has reduced significantly in North China, especially over the bend of the Yellow River, central Inner Mongolia, and the coastal areas surrounding Bohai Bay. Serious drought has occurred in some of the above areas. The El Niño episode reached its peak strength during November-December 2015, when a lower-troposphere anomalous anticyclonic circulation prevailed over the Philippines, bringing about abnormal southerlies and substantially increased precipitation in southeastern China. At the same time, a negative phase of the Eurasia-Pacific teleconnection pattern dominated over the mid-high latitudes, which suppressed northerly winds in North China. These two factors together resulted in high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and frequent haze weather in this region. Currently, this strong El Niño is weakening very rapidly, but its impact on climate will continue in the coming months in some regions, especially in China.",

The subtropical Chloridoideae (e.g. Cynodon dactylon; Bermuda grass) and Panicoideae (e.g. Paspalum notatum; Bahia grass) species are abundant in parts of Africa, India, Asia, Australia and the Americas, where a large and increasing proportion of the world's population abide. These grasses are phylogenetically and ecologically distinct from temperate grasses. With the advent of global warming, it is conceivable that the geographic distribution of subtropical grasses and the contribution of their pollen to the burden of allergic rhinitis and asthma will increase. This review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current global knowledge of (i) regional variation in allergic sensitivity to subtropical grass pollens, (ii) molecular allergenic components of subtropical grass pollens and (iii) allergic responses to subtropical grass pollen allergens in relevant populations. Patients from subtropical regions of the world show higher allergic sensitivity to grass pollens of Chloridoideae and Panicoideae grasses, than to temperate grass pollens. The group 1 allergens are amongst the allergen components of subtropical grass pollens, but the group 5 allergens, by which temperate grass pollen extracts are standardized for allergen content, appear to be absent from both subfamilies of subtropical grasses. Whilst there are shared allergenic components and antigenic determinants, there are additional clinically relevant subfamily-specific differences, at T- and B-cell levels, between pollen allergens of subtropical and temperate grasses. Differential immune recognition of subtropical grass pollens is likely to impact upon the efficacy of allergen immunotherapy of patients who are primarily sensitized to subtropical grass pollens. The literature reviewed herein highlights the clinical need to standardize allergen preparations for both types of subtropical grass pollens to achieve optimal diagnosis and treatment of patients with allergic respiratory disease in subtropical regions of the world.",

However, cement production releases high amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere that leads to increasing the global warming. The concrete materials also have been developed to be functioned as self-cleaning construction materials. The self-cleaning properties of the concrete are induced by introducing the photo catalytic materials such as titania (TiO2) and zinc oxide (Zn O). Self-cleaning concrete that contains those photo catalysts will be energized by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and accelerates the decomposition of organic particulates. Thus, the cleanliness of the building surfaces can be maintained and the air surrounding air pollution can be reduced. In this paper a brief study has been carried out on the properties of self cleaning concrete using Titanium dioxide. The decolourization and oxidation effect are studied using Rhoda mine dye and nitrogen dioxide respectively. Dr. S. U.

In general, these changes have been associated with global warming. Here we present a study of thermal growing season (GS) trends in the Greater Baltic Area, northern Europe. Yearly dates for the start, end and length of the GS were computed for 49 stations in the studied area, using daily mean temperature measurements. Trends and tendencies of the GS parameters were analysed within the twentieth century. We also examined GS trends in long records (starting before 1850) from the region. The results show a general increase of the length of the GS of ca one week since 1951 in the area, where the most considerable change has occurred in spring (starting ∼6 days earlier). The largest increases were found at stations adjacent to the Baltic Sea and North Sea, where some Danish stations showed significant increasing trends in the length of the GS of more than 20 days. The only tendency for a shorter GS was found in Archangelsk, north western Russia. The three longest records displayed large inter-annual and decadal variability, with tendencies for increased frequencies of longer growing seasons since the 1950s.",

         "pages": "no--no","abstract": "Habitat ranges of most species shift over time, for instance due to climate change, human intervention, or adaptation. These demographic changes often have drastic population genetic effects, such as a stochastic resampling of the gene pool through the \u201Csurfing\u201D phenomenon. Most models assume that the speed of range expansions is only limited by the dispersal ability of the colonizing species and its reproductive potential. While such models of \u201Cphenotype-limited\u201D expansions apply to species invasions, it is clear that many range expansions are limited rather by the slow motion of habitat boundaries, as driven for instance by global warming. Here, we develop a coalescent model to study the genetic impact of such \u201Cboundary-limited\u201D range expansions. Our simulations and analysis show that the resulting loss of genetic diversity is markedly lower than in species invasions if large carrying capacities can be maintained up to the habitat frontier. Counterintuitively, we find that the total loss of diversity does not depend on the speed of the range expansion: Slower expansions have a smaller rate of loss, but also last longer. Boundary-limited range expansions exhibit a characteristic genetic footprint and should therefore be distinguished from range expansions limited only by intrinsic characteristics of the species.",

The production of fibres contributes to global warming by releasing carbon dioxide and other harmful substances into the atmosphere. It also manages waste produced during production and field use. Consequently, incorporating industrial waste in the concretes formulation can help to mitigate ecological and environmental problems. In this present study, cement concrete was given an extra material of fibre waste polypropylene fibre . To boost the concretes compressive and split tensile strengths, polypropylene fibre PPF , a synthetic hydrocarbon polymer, has been used. As part of this experiment, we produced a range of specimens utilising various polypropylene waste concentrations, including 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , and 1.00 . Pankaj Tiwari | R. S.

These CO<sub>2</sub> \"sinks\" are modulated by climate change and variability. Here we use a suite of nine dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and four ocean biogeochemical general circulation models (OBGCMs) to estimate trends driven by global and regional climate and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in land and oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> exchanges with the atmosphere over the period 1990\u20132009, to attribute these trends to underlying processes in the models, and to quantify the uncertainty and level of inter-model agreement. The models were forced with reconstructed climate fields and observed global atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>; land use and land cover changes are not included for the DGVMs. Over the period 1990\u20132009, the DGVMs simulate a mean global land carbon sink of −2.4 ± 0.7 Pg C yr<sup>−1</sup> with a small significant trend of −0.06 ± 0.03 Pg C yr<sup>−2</sup> (increasing sink). Over the more limited period 1990\u20132004, the ocean models simulate a mean ocean sink of −2.2 ± 0.2 Pg C yr<sup>−1</sup> with a trend in the net C uptake that is indistinguishable from zero (−0.01 ± 0.02 Pg C yr<sup>−2</sup>). The two ocean models that extended the simulations until 2009 suggest a slightly stronger, but still small, trend of −0.02 ± 0.01 Pg C yr<sup>−2</sup>. Trends from land and ocean models compare favourably to the land greenness trends from remote sensing, atmospheric inversion results, and the residual land sink required to close the global carbon budget. Trends in the land sink are driven by increasing net primary production (NPP), whose statistically significant trend of 0.22 ± 0.08 Pg C yr<sup>−2</sup> exceeds a significant trend in heterotrophic respiration of 0.16 ± 0.05 Pg C yr<sup>−2</sup> \u2013 primarily as a consequence of widespread CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation of plant production. Most of the land-based trend in simulated net carbon uptake originates from natural ecosystems in the tropics (−0.04 ± 0.01 Pg C yr<sup>−2</sup>), with almost no trend over the northern land region, where recent warming and reduced rainfall offsets the positive impact of elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and changes in growing season length on carbon storage. The small uptake trend in the ocean models emerges because climate variability and change, and in particular increasing sea surface temperatures, tend to counter\\-act the trend in ocean uptake driven by the increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Large uncertainty remains in the magnitude and sign of modelled carbon trends in several regions, as well as regarding the influence of land use and land cover changes on regional trends.</p>",

This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the \"dust bowl'' era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding approximate to 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.",

In this study, we have identified rice and maize crop responses to temperature in different, but consistent, phenological phases and development stages. A literature review and data compilation of around 140 scientific articles have determined the key temperature thresholds and response to extreme temperature effects for rice and maize, complementing an earlier study on wheat. Lethal temperatures and cardinal temperatures, together with error estimates, have been identified for phenological phases and development stages. Following the methodology of previous work, we have collected and statistically analysed temperature thresholds of the three crops for the key physiological processes such as leaf initiation, shoot growth and root growth and for the most susceptible phenological phases such as sowing to emergence, anthesis and grain filling. Our summary shows that cardinal temperatures are conservative between studies and are seemingly well defined in all three crops. Anthesis and ripening are the most sensitive temperature stages in rice as well as in wheat and maize. We call for further experimental studies of the effects of transgressing threshold temperatures so such responses can be included into crop impact and adaptation models.",

The past strength of the rain-bearing East Asian summer monsoon can be reconstructed with archives such as cave deposits1, 2, 3, but the winter monsoon has no such signature in the hydrological cycle and has thus proved difficult to reconstruct. Here we present high-resolution records of the magnetic properties and the titanium content of the sediments of Lake Huguang Maar in coastal southeast China over the past 16,000 years, which we use as proxies for the strength of the winter monsoon winds. We find evidence for stronger winter monsoon winds before the Bølling\u2013Allerød warming, during the Younger Dryas episode and during the middle and late Holocene, when cave stalagmites suggest weaker summer monsoons1, 2, 3. We conclude that this anticorrelation is best explained by migrations in the intertropical convergence zone. Similar migrations of the intertropical convergence zone have been observed in Central America for the period ad 700 to 900 (refs 4\u20136), suggesting global climatic changes at that time. From the coincidence in timing, we suggest that these migrations in the tropical rain belt could have contributed to the declines of both the Tang dynasty in China and the Classic Maya in Central America.",

We can also operate the generator with low thermal energy by exhaust heat of IC engine. The fossil fuel remain main source of energy but contribute a tremendous amount of pollutants in the environment leading to global warming ,so for the purpose of refrigerator and air conditioning a vapour absorption refrigeration system could be used. this system utilizes the wasteful heat from heavy vehicle exhaust and work on VARS which provides the cooling and reducing various costs like fuel and maintenance. The research has been done in order to recover maximum waste heat and then analyzing the system performance. Through this system the researchers has tried to find out the maximum COP.

Natural fibers have the advantage that they are renewable resources and have marketing appeal. Due to the demand and needs we want to find out new combination eco- friendly materials either recyclable, bio degradable or not affect the environment. In this fibers may be using for recyclable packaging, sealing, and fabrication applications. So want to study the properties of Maize fibers. Alkaline treating is essential one of Natural fibers treating. Alkaline treated Maize fibers properties are having better Tensile and elongation compare to raw Maize fibers. After the Alkali treatment go for Compression molding process and study the properties of the composites through conducting tensile test, TWAD Ph test and FTIR test etc. That result shows raw maize fiber better than alkali treated Maize fiber for using various applications.",

Lozier et al. report initial results from the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) (see the Perspective by Rhein). OSNAP has been measuring the flux of water transported by overturning in the high latitudes in the North Atlantic. The measurements reveal the strong variability of transport in the region and show that deep water formation in the Labrador Sea may not, as previously believed, be the major determinant of AMOC variability.Science, this issue p. 516; see also p. 456To provide an observational basis for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections of a slowing Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the 21st century, the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) observing system was launched in the summer of 2014. The first 21-month record reveals a highly variable overturning circulation responsible for the majority of the heat and freshwater transport across the OSNAP line. In a departure from the prevailing view that changes in deep water formation in the Labrador Sea dominate MOC variability, these results suggest that the conversion of warm, salty, shallow Atlantic waters into colder, fresher, deep waters that move southward in the Irminger and Iceland basins is largely responsible for overturning and its variability in the subpolar basin.",

Based on the observational analysis, the climate change has significant effects, both positive and negative, in every field within the study area, and with the harmful effects far more prevalent. Under the scenario A1B, it is reported that temperature, precipitation, days of heat waves and extreme precipitation intensity will increase at respective rates of 0.38°C per decade, 12.6 mm per decade, 6.4 d and 47 mm per decade in the 21st century. It is widely believed that these climate changes in the future will result in some apparent impacts on agro-ecosystems, water resources, wetland ecosystem, forest ecosystem, human health, energy sectors and other sensitive fields in Central China. Due to the limited scientific knowledge and researches, there are still some shortages in the climate change assessment methodologies and many uncertainties in the climate prediction results. Therefore, it is urgent and essential to increase the studies of the regional climate change adaptation, extend the research fields, and enhance the studies in the extreme weather and climate events to reduce the uncertainties of the climate change assessments.

So it is required to solve these problems by taking various serious attempts. Hence to reduce these pollutants from Exhaust of Engine a new technology is introduced called Aqua silencer. Sound produced under water is less hearable than it produced in atmosphere. This mainly because of small sprockets in water molecules, which lowers its amplitude thus, lowers the sound level. Because of this property water is used in this silencer and hence its name AQUA SILENCER. Aqua Silencer is a modified version of a conventional silencer aimed at the reduction of toxic emission. Aqua silencer is one of the attempt taken in reduce the air pollution. It is fitted to the exhaust pipe of engine or system. These Silencers is used to reduce the noise and control the emission of dangerous gases. An aqua silencer is an attempt in this direction which is mainly dealing with control of emission and noise. . The aqua silencer system is design for replace commonly used single unit silencers in engine with its slender structure and less weight.

Given such climate conditions, it becomes compelling to limit the use of artificial energy sources and find ways to help us control the temperature of a place. This paper deals with reducing the energy consumption of a building without affecting its required temperature by combining different building orientations using an information system. It gives a clear picture of the best suited situation for a particular place. We have used the design software and incorporated factors such as the orientation of the building. It will provide us with the required amount of artificial energy, taking the ideal temperature of the building into account. It will also tell us the difference this setup can make in the long term cost of the building. If these parameters are taken into consideration before building design, better returns in terms of energy savings and long term financial benefits can be achieved.

In particular, I focus on the use of ocean observations to initialize predictions in ocean and climate models. Examples are also shown of how models can be used to assess the impact of both current ocean observations and to simulate that of potential new ocean observing platforms. The ocean has never been better observed than it is today and similarly ocean models have never been as capable at representing the real ocean as they are now. However, there remain important unanswered questions that can likely only be addressed via future improvements in ocean observations. In particular, ocean observing systems need to respond to the needs of the burgeoning field of near-term climate predictions. Although new ocean observing platforms promise exciting new discoveries, there is a delicate balance to be made between their funding and that of the current ocean observing system. Here, I identify the need to secure long-term funding for ocean observing platforms as they mature, from a mainly research exercise to an operational system for sustained observation over climate change time scales. At the same time, considerable progress continues to be made via ship-based observing campaigns and I highlight some that are dedicated to addressing uncertainties in key ocean model parametrizations. The use of ocean observations to understand the prominent long time scale changes observed in the North Atlantic is another focus of this paper. The exciting first decade of monitoring of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation by the RAPID-MOCHA array is highlighted. The use of ocean and climate models as tools to further probe the drivers of variability seen in such time series is another exciting development. I also discuss the need for a concerted combined effort from climate models and ocean observations in order to understand the current slow-down in surface global warming.",

The sea state was simulated for the 30-year period 2071\u20132100 using the wave model WAM and an ensemble of wind field data sets for four climate change realizations as driving data. The wind field data sets are based on simulation outputs from two global circulation models (GCMs: HadAM3H and ECHAM4/OPYC3) for two emission scenarios (A2 and B2, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Special Report on Emission Scenarios). They were regionalized by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute using the regional climate model RCAO. The effects of the climate realizations on the sea state statistics were assessed by analyzing the differences between the patterns in the four CGM/emission scenario combinations and those in two control simulations representing reference wave climate conditions for the 30-year period 1961\u20131990. The analysis of the four emission scenario/GCM combinations has shown that the future long-term 99 percentile wind speed and significant wave height increase by up to 7\\% and 18\\%, respectively, in the North Sea, except for significant wave height off the English coast and to the north in the HadAM3H-driven simulation. The climate change response in the ECHAM4/OPYC3-forced experiments is generally larger than in the HadAM3H-driven simulations. The differences in future significant wave height between the different combinations are in the same order of magnitude as those between the control runs for the two GCMs. Nevertheless, there is agreement among the four combinations that extreme wave heights may increase in large parts in the southern and eastern North Sea by about 0.25 to 0.35 m (5\u20138\\% of present values) towards the end of the twenty first century in case of global warming. All combinations also show an increase in future frequency of severe sea state.",

Lack of green forest is cause of global warming and climate change etc, so everyone needs everything to be Green to save the earth. Day-to-day People's interests are growing for green movement in different fields. In the field of Library and Information Science, a new concept named Sustainable Library or Green Library having popularity among LIS Professionals. People need green food to feed as well as green Library to read. Green Library is not only a thought, but also a movement towards the sustainable development of libraries all over the world particularly in development countries. The green library movement involves librarians, library staff, library users, libraries that are dedicated to greening libraries and reducing the environmental degradation. ``Feed Green to Read Green'' is a sign of ``as people take care their body for a better health, they should take care their library's health (development). It calls for ``Go Green'' in daily foods as well as daily library activities.",

Photovoltaic (PV) cells can be used to generate dc voltages and given to Buck boost converter. The buck boost converter output is given to battery to inverter and load. Buck boost converter gives constant output which will control by PWM controller and feedback control system. Feedback control system has compensation network with different types and parameters. Depending upon parameters and controlling method, we have to decide stability analysis using Bode Plot. This analysis is carried out by using MATLAB software. It will be used to design buck boost converter with different parameters which gives constant output. It is helpful for optimizing feedback-loop design for the best transient response while maintaining a comfortable margin for stability. Design for highest gain and bandwidth feedback loop. It is useful to study different controlling methods and comparison. It is used to select switching frequency, power inductor, selecting capacitors and verify the quality of the output voltage, harmonic content of the output voltage.",

The greening initiative at the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS) Nakuru branch was ranked among the top five applications for the IFLA Green Library Award competition 2017. The green library concept is slowly gaining momentum and recognition in Kenya, as public institutions such as universities and public/community libraries endeavour to construct libraries that meet our next generation of users\u2019 behaviour and expectations. A library building plan must include an environmental impact statement to ensure a low carbon footprint and that improved library services are offered efficiently and effectively (Druaipandi 2016). This paper presents the green library initiatives undertaken by KNLS Nakuru branch in line with the green library movement. These initiatives include the sustainable library building and reading tree initiative in some public primary schools which are members of the library book clubs within Nakuru County. The paper defines the green library/ sustainable library building concept by giving examples and expanding on the reading tree concept as embraced by the Nakuru library. It is hoped that other libraries will embrace the idea and help address environmental problems such as climate change, global warming and air pollution that have adversely affected Kenya and the wider world.",

Future climate change will likely affect these storm tracks and the associated transport of energy, momentum, and water vapour. Many recent studies have analyzed how storm tracks will change under climate change, and how these changes are related to atmospheric dynamics. However, there are still discrepancies between different studies on how storm tracks will change under future climate scenarios. Here, we show that under global warming the CMIP5 ensemble of coupled climate models projects only little relative changes in vertically averaged mid-latitude mean storm track activity during the northern winter, but agree in projecting a substantial decrease during summer. Seasonal changes in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite behaviour, with an intensification in winter and no change during summer. These distinct seasonal changes in northern summer and southern winter storm tracks lead to an amplified seasonal cycle in a future climate. Similar changes are seen in the mid-latitude mean Eady growth rate maximum, a measure that combines changes in vertical shear and static stability based on baroclinic instability theory. Regression analysis between changes in the storm tracks and changes in the maximum Eady growth rate reveal that most models agree in a positive association between the two quantities over mid-latitude regions.",

Extreme events were defined by duration and recurrence interval, the event durations chosen were 1, 5, 10 and 30 days and the event thresholds were those associated with recurrence intervals of 1, 5 and 10 years. The results indicated that temporal variations of extreme precipitation index (EPI) showed interannual and interdecadal variability. Time series of anomalies of the nine regional EPI indices indicated that Northeast China, North China and the Yellow River basin had experienced a decreasing trend of extreme rainfall events during the last 50 years, while other six regions, namely the Yangtze River basin, Southeast Coast, South China, the Inner Mongolia, Northwest China and Tibetan Plateau, had experienced an increasing trend of extreme rainfall events. Seasonal results indicated that 95.6% of 1-day, 1-yr recurrence interval extreme rainfall events occurred from April to September in China. The possible attributions of trend and variability of extreme rainfall events at China include, but are not limited to, El Niño \u2013 Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the magnitude of East Asian Monsoon, wind circulations, as well as global warming. Obviously these factors are not independent. For example, it has long been recognized that ENSO can exert an important impact on the East Asian monsoon.",

The exploding popularity of social networks, however, presents a new opportunity to research the spatiotemporal pattern of public discourse in relation to natural and/or socio-economic events. Among the social networks, Twitter is one of the largest microblogging services. The architecture of Twitter makes the question  \u201D what's happening?\u201D the cornerstone of information exchange. This inspired the notion of using Twitter users as distributed sensors, which has been successfully employed in both the natural and social sciences. In 2012 and 2013, we collected 1.8 million tweets on  \u201D climate change\u201D and  \u201D global warming\u201D in five major languages (English, German, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish). We discuss the geography of tweeting, weekly and daily patterns, major news events that affected tweeting on climate change, changes in the central topics of discussion over time, the most authoritative traditional media, blogging, and the most authoritative organizational sources of information on climate change referenced by Twitter users in different countries. We anticipate that social network mining will become a major source of data in the public discourse on climate change.",

The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have increased significantly since the start of the Industrial Era around 1750, with much of this increase occurring over just the last 50 years or so. This is resulting in warming of the climate system as well as changes in precipitation and weather and climate extremes. These changes in climate are having wide-ranging impacts on the Earth's physical, biological and human systems, including human health. It is these impacts of climate change on human health that are the focus of this paper, particularly the impacts on allergens and allergic diseases. Such impacts are particularly significant in many countries where the prevalence of such diseases is high and/or increasing. There is now compelling evidence that rising air temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations are, in some plant species, resulting in increased pollen production and allergenicity and advancement and lengthening of the pollen season. Changes in extreme events, such as thunderstorms and tropical cyclones, will also have impacts on allergic diseases, with, for example, the flooding associated with tropical cyclones leading to proliferation of mould growth in damp homes. The article also considers a range of responses to these health threats, including greenhouse gas mitigation, and adaptation strategies, such as enhanced environmental monitoring and health surveillance and adequate planning for the future medical workforce.",

         "volume": "453","number": "7191","pages": "84--88","abstract": "The climate of the North Atlantic region exhibits fluctuations on decadal timescales that have large societal consequences. Prominent examples include hurricane activity in the Atlantic1, and surface-temperature and rainfall variations over North America2, Europe3 and northern Africa4. Although these multidecadal variations are potentially predictable if the current state of the ocean is known5, 6, 7, the lack of subsurface ocean observations8 that constrain this state has been a limiting factor for realizing the full skill potential of such predictions9. Here we apply a simple approach\u2014that uses only sea surface temperature (SST) observations\u2014to partly overcome this difficulty and perform retrospective decadal predictions with a climate model. Skill is improved significantly relative to predictions made with incomplete knowledge of the ocean state10, particularly in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific oceans. Thus these results point towards the possibility of routine decadal climate predictions. Using this method, and by considering both internal natural climate variations and projected future anthropogenic forcing, we make the following forecast: over the next decade, the current Atlantic meridional overturning circulation will weaken to its long-term mean; moreover, North Atlantic SST and European and North American surface temperatures will cool slightly, whereas tropical Pacific SST will remain almost unchanged. Our results suggest that global surface temperature may not increase over the next decade, as natural climate variations in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic warming.",

We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-the-art knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100 EJ: high agreement; 100\u2013300 EJ: medium agreement; above 300 EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245 EJ yr−1 to global primary energy supply by 2050.

The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts.

         "volume": "5","number": "3","pages": "986-991","abstract": "Since from the last centuries, water has been affected due to many parameters and actions done by human beings. Due to these actions drinking water becomes dangerous and harmful with increase in living population and also due to global warming and changes in natural climate. So, in upcoming generation we need safe drinking water for all living things. For these safety measures we need to first monitor the quality of the drinking water. In earlier days, people used some manual types of measurements for monitoring the water. But it takes more time and it has less efficiency. So, we need a better idea to check the quality of the water because water is more essential for all living things. By considering all these necessities, we develop a new methodology for monitoring the quality of the given water using IOT environment with low level of cost and with high efficiency. We also ensure real time data value by developing a web application using wi fi module, which can be accessed at anywhere. A. Guna Selvi | S. Vibhithra | A.

         "abstract": "Students, academics and researchers will find this book an invaluable contribution to the understanding of thermodynamics. In this new treatment of the subject, the authors focus on the principles of thermodynamic variables and the practical simulation of thermodynamic systems, and endeavour to show how simple thermodynamics really is by applying two innovations:\r\n\r\nThe use of entropy as thermal charge and not as the incomprehensible Clausius integral (an idea which applies only in special cases);\r\nThe use of Bond Graphs to represent relations among variables. This tool from control and systems engineering has been treated extensively in other publications by Springer, including two books by Prof. Thoma, and is succinctly explained here in an appendix.\r\nThe book opens with thermodynamics as universal science and with entropy as carrier of thermal power, and goes on to consider the effects of friction, including the Carnot cycle. Next, it treats systems with variable mass and variable mass flow and extends the concepts to chemical reactions and osmosis. Finally, descending by some 20 orders of magnitude, it considers single atoms and degrees of freedom of atoms, with statistical aspects of information theory. There are also sections on biology (written in collaboration with Prof. Henri Atlan of Paris and Jerusalem) and on earth science (global warming).\r\n\r\nA modern approach with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary engineering, this book offers a unique view of modern complex systems engineering and its ramifications, and contributes to the advance of pluridisciplinarity among scientists.",

In the last decades there is an increasing interest in the development of the bioethanol production from lignocellulosic residues, which do not compete directly with food. However, the low efficient conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels hinders its success hence the need to constantly explore new, cheap and readily available raw materials. In this work, the capability of typed strains of Z. mobilis, S. cerevisiae as well as the co culture of Z. mobilis and S. cerevisiae (1:1) to produce ethanol by saccharification and fermentation process from tomato stalk was investigated and compared. The results shows the optimal ethanol yield of 4.00, 6.70 and 10.97% (v/v) was obtained from S. cerevisiae, Z. mobilis and the co culture of S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis after 6 days of fermentation. The combination of S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis yielded the highest ethanol when compared with the yields obtained when the organisms were used separately since the combination of the bacteria and yeast undergoes EMP and ED pathways which converts sugar into alcohol. The identity of the produced ethanol was confirmed by its density and IR spectrum. The results of this study suggest that agro waste should no longer be discarded but converted to useful products like bioethanol since it contains fermentable sugars.",

The regional scale changes of snow cover during winter, however, vary significantly from one region to another. In the present study, snow cover variability over Europe and its connection to other atmospheric variables was investigated using Cyclostationary Empirical Orthogonal Function (CSEOF) analysis. The evolution of atmospheric variables related to each CSEOF mode of snow cover variability was derived via regression analysis in CSEOF space. CSEOF analysis clearly shows that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is related to European snow cover, particularly in January and February. A negative NAO phase tends to result in a snow cover increases, whereas a positive NAO phase results in snow cover decreases. The temporal changes in the connection between the NAO and European snow cover are explained by time-dependent NAO-related temperature anomalies. If the NAO phase is negative, the temperature is lower in Europe and snow cover increases; by contrast, when the NAO phase is positive, the temperature is higher and snow cover decreases. Temperature and snow cover variations in Europe are associated with the thermal advection by anomalous wind by NAO. CSEOF analysis also shows an abrupt increase of snow cover in December and January and a decrease in February and March since the year 2000, approximately. This abrupt change is associated with sub-seasonal variations of atmospheric circulation in the study region.",

The objective of the work is on carbon emission elimination  with the use of Magneto Hydrodynamic (MHD) system.  This system was constructed with Alinco magnets of 8200Guass strength and metal construction with steel of gauge 17. The Magneto hydrodynamic system constructed was used to run three sets of tests for sixty minutes taking readings of 0.5minute,1minute, 2minute, 3minute, 4minute, 5minute, 10 minute, 15minute, 20minute, 25minute, 30minute, 35minute, 40minute, 45minute, 50minute, 55minute, 60minute, and the average was taken. The temperature, oxygen output, carbon (iv) oxide, and the efficiency of the exhaust fume from 800watts generator was measured with and without the constructed Magneto hydrodynamics. The results showed a complete elimination of carbon (iv) oxide, an increase in the combustion efficiency from 83% to 87% on the average, an increase in the oxygen produced from 10% to 20% on the average and a reduction of the exhaust temperature from 264.53o C to 109.53o C. It was observed from the result that there was a total elimination of carbon (iv) oxide this implies that it completely removed the produced carbon(iv) oxide from the 800watts generator, therefore it is completely environmentally safe, also the heat reduction of the output shows a recovery of waste heat from the exhaust system, this improving the energy efficiency.",

Thus, a negative flow of CO2 from the atmosphere to the subsurface is established. The potential of BECCS to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (in addition to generating energy) makes it an attractive approach to help achieving the ambitious global warming targets of COP 21. BECCS has a range of variables such as the type of biomass resource, the conversion technology, the CO2capture process used and storage options. Each of the pathways to connect these options has its own environmental, economic and social impacts. This study attempts to integrate these impacts into a three pillar sustainability framework (3PSF) approach. As an example, the 3PSF approach is applied to bioenergy from organic waste collected from municipal solid waste (MSW). Global and Australian potentials for using municipal solid waste as resource for bioenergy and coupling it with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), was investigated. Two BECCS systems, municipal solid waste incineration with carbon capture and storage (MSW-CCS) and landfill gas combusted in gas turbine with carbon capture and storage (LFG-CCS) were modelled. In the case of business-as-usual scenarios with no emission policy in place, the cost of electricity from both BECCS options is higher than for unmitigated coal power generation. However, introducing renewable energy certificate or negative emission refunding schemes has a significant impact on the economic viability of these technologies. Environmental impact assessments show that in the MSW-CCS model, for each kg of wet MSW incinerated around 0.7 kg CO2,eq is removed from the atmosphere. BECCS has the potential to be a valuable step towards a low-carbon energy system. However, if planned unsustainably it could compromise the natural ecosystem and social equity. The importance of the presented study is in its holistic approach to assessing the sustainability of different BECCS routes and providing a comprehensive adaptive management system that enables decision-makers to plan BECCS options in a transparent and timely manner.",

Through diagnoses of ensembles of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments, we demonstrate that this climate change is a response to the temporal history of sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Specifically, 58 of 67 multi-model ensemble members (87\\%), forced with observed global SSTs since 1950, simulate a positive trend in a winter index of the NAO, and the spatial pattern of the multi-model ensemble mean trend agrees with that observed. An ensemble of AGCM simulations with only tropical SST forcing further suggests that variations in these SSTs are of primary importance. The probability distribution function (PDF) of 50-year NAO index trends from the forced simulations are, moreover, appreciably different from the PDF of a control simulation with no interannual SST variability, although chaotic atmospheric variations are shown to yield substantial 50-year trends. Our results thus advance the view that the observed linear trend in the winter NAO index is a combination of a strong tropically forced signal and an appreciable  \u201D noise\u201D component of the same phase. The changes in tropical rainfall of greatest relevance include increased rainfall over the equatorial Indian Ocean, a change that has likely occurred in nature and is physically consistent with the observed, significant warming trend of the underlying sea surface.",

Gene expression was significantly affected by FACE and 400\u2013600 up-regulated or down-regulated genes were identified in each experimental condition. Overall, elevated soil temperature was likely to increase the number of differently expressed genes. Among them, only 31 up-regulated and 83 down-regulated genes were common irrespective of the leaf stage and soil temperature. These included up-regulation of sucrose transporter and fructosyltransferase and down-regulation of chlorophyll a/b binding protein, nitrate transporter and aquaporin, though most of differently expressed genes were functionally unknown. Although there were some exceptions, the expression of most of primary metabolism genes was not significantly altered by FACE. The expression of genes related to CO2 fixation such as Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase were down-regulated, whereas a large proportion of genes related to sucrose synthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle and N fixation were up-regulated under FACE, though changes were small in all cases. These results might reflect the transcriptional adaptation of metabolism to FACE, reducing the CO2 fixation capacity and stimulating the dark respiration.",

In our present study the specific area is Assam where we face a big problem of climate change due to deforestation and other many causes. Deforestation can be defined as the clearing or removal of forest for specific reasons such as rapid industrialization, tea plantation, poverty etc whereby the land available for non- forest use. This dissolve actions of mankind which are causing an intolerable imbalance in nature and is a major factor leading to climate change, extinction of rare animals, desertification and displacement of population etc. Deforestation is also one of the major cause of a disturbed water cycle, global warming and soil erosion. If not controlled, the imbalance is likely to threaten life on Earth. The paper discusses the causes and problems of deforestation in Assam and trys to give some suggestions and highlight the government schemes to reduce it. The study recommends that to reduce deforestation in our state the central and the state governments, the NGO and the public jointly should take some immediate steps for reforestation and the states forest policy need to be strengthen by acquiring legal support for better implementation of government scheme.

Complex ocean and climate models are widely applied to estimate magnitude and timing of related impacts under global warming.\r\nWe discuss the role of the ocean mean state, subpolar water mass transformation, mesoscale eddies, and atmospheric coupling in shaping the response of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean to enhanced Greenland runoff.\r\nIn a suite of eight dedicated 60- to 100-year-long model experiments with and without atmospheric coupling, with eddy processes parameterized and explicitly simulated and with regular and significantly enlarged Greenland runoff, we find\r\n(1) a major impact by the interactive atmosphere in enabling a compensating temperature feedback,\r\n(2) a non-negligible influence by the ocean mean state biased towards greater stability in the coupled simulations,\r\nboth of which make the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation less susceptible to the freshwater perturbation applied, and\r\n(3) a more even spreading and deeper mixing of the runoff tracer in the subpolar North Atlantic and enhanced inter-gyre exchange with the subtropics in the strongly eddying simulations.\r\nOverall, our experiments demonstrate the important role of mesoscale ocean dynamics and atmosphere feedback in projections of the climate system response to enhanced Greenland Ice Sheet melting and hence underline the necessity to advance scale-aware eddy parameterizations for next-generation climate models.</p>",

         "pages": "n/a--n/a","abstract": "Global warming is expected to intensify the hydrologic cycle. Documenting whether significant changes in the extreme precipitation regimes have already happened is consequently one of the challenging topics in climatic research.The high natural variability of extreme precipitation often prevents from obtaining significant results when testing changes in the empirical distribution of extreme rainfall at regional scale. A regional integrated approach is proposed here as one possible answer to this complex methodological problem. Three methods are combined in order to detect regionally significant trends and/or break-points in series of annual maximum daily rainfall: \r\n\r\n\r\n* Individual stationarity tests applied to the raw point series of maxima\r\n\r\n* A maximum likelihood testing of time dependent GEV distributions fitted to theses series\r\n\r\n* A heuristic testing of a regional time dependent GEV distributionThis approach is applied to a set of 126 daily rain gauges covering the Sahel over the period 1950\u20131990. It is found that only a few stations are tested as non-stationary when applying classical tests on the raw series while the two GEV-based models converge to show that the extreme rainfall series indeed underwent a negative break-point around 1970. The study evidences the limits of the widely used classical stationarity tests to detect trends in noisy series affected by sampling uncertainties, while using a parametric space and time dependent GEV efficiently reduces this effect. Showing that the great Sahelian drought was accompanied by a significant decrease of extreme rainfall events is the other main result of this study.",

The reoccurrence of this conflict posed greater challenges and concern among authorities and the citizenry of Nigeria. Many factors have been attributed to this which include among others climate change, competition for scarce land resources, global warming also caused available space water to dry up, the collapse of old traditional negotiation mechanisms between groups, encroachment by farmers, and other government nongovernmental activities on cattle routes, etc. The conflict which was prevalent in the northern part of the country has increased spreading throughout Nigeria, most especially some parts of southern states, namely Oyo and Ondo. Therefore, this paper examined the socio cultural analysis of the conflict in Ondo State using a secondary source of data collection. The paper recommended restoration of traditional negotiation mechanisms between farmers and herdsmen, enhanced harmonious relationship between the groups, synergy among various security agencies, establishment and resuscitation of abandoned cattle ranching reserves, the establishment of a joint farmers herdsmen forum to facilitate proper dissemination of information towards curbing the conflict.

Wind, solar energy, biomass, mini hydro, and the usage of fuel cells and microturbines will provide substantial impetus in the near future. Environmental friendliness, expandability, and flexibility have made distributed generation, powered by a variety of renewable and unconventional energy sources, an appealing alternative for building contemporary electrical systems. A microgrid is made up of a group of loads and dispersed generators that work together to form a single controlled system. Microgrids, as an integrated energy delivery system, may function in tandem with or independently of the main power grid. The microgrid idea reduces the number of reverse conversions in a single AC or DC grid while also making it easier to link variable renewable AC and DC sources and loads to power systems. The connectivity of DGs to the utility grid through power electronic converters has raised concerns regarding equipment safety and protection. The microgrid may be configured to fulfil the customers specific needs, such as greater local dependability, reduced feeder losses, local voltage support, greater efficiency via waste heat usage, voltage sag correction, or uninterruptible power supply. The performance of a hybrid AC DC microgrid system in grid tethered mode is examined in this paper. For the creation of a microgrid, a solar system, a wind turbine generator, and a battery are utilized. Control methods are also included to allow the converters to appropriately coordinate the AC sub grid with the DC sub grid. The MATLAB SIMULINK environment was used to achieve the findings.

All else being equal, C4 plants tend to be favored over C3 plants in warm humid climates and, conversely, C3 plants tend to be favored over C4 plants in cool climates. Empirical observations supported by a photosynthesis model predict the existence of a climatological crossover temperature above which C4 species have a carbon gain advantage and below which C3 species are favored. Model calculations and analysis of current plant distribution suggest that this pCO2-dependent crossover temperature is approximated by a mean temperature of 22°C for the warmest month at the current pCO2 (35\u2009Pa). In addition to favorable temperatures, C4 plants require sufficient precipitation during the warm growing season. C4 plants which are predominantly graminoids of short stature can be competitively excluded by trees (nearly all C3 plants) \u2013 regardless of the photosynthetic superiority of the C4 pathway \u2013 in regions otherwise favorable for C4. To construct global maps of the distribution of C4 grasses for current, past and future climate scenarios, we make use of climatological data sets which provide estimates of the mean monthly temperature to classify the globe into areas which should favor C4 photosynthesis during at least 1 month of the year. This area is further screened by excluding areas where precipitation is <25\u2009mm per month during the warm season and by selecting areas classified as grasslands (i.e., excluding areas dominated by woody vegetation) according to a global vegetation map. Using this approach, grasslands of the world are designated as C3, C4, and mixed under current climate and pCO2. Published floristic studies were used to test the accuracy of these predictions in many regions of the world, and agreement with observations was generally good. We then make use of this protocol to examine changes in the global abundance of C4 grasses in the past and the future using plausible estimates for the climates and pCO2. When pCO2 is lowered to pre-industrial levels, C4 grasses expanded their range into large areas now classified as C3 grasslands, especially in North America and Eurasia. During the last glacial maximum (∼18\u2009ka\u2009BP) when the climate was cooler and pCO2 was about 20\u2009Pa, our analysis predicts substantial expansion of C4 vegetation \u2013 particularly in Asia, despite cooler temperatures. Continued use of fossil fuels is expected to result in double the current pCO2 by sometime in the next century, with some associated climate warming. Our analysis predicts a substantial reduction in the area of C4 grasses under these conditions. These reductions from the past and into the future are based on greater stimulation of C3 photosynthetic efficiency by higher pCO2 than inhibition by higher temperatures. The predictions are testable through large-scale controlled growth studies and analysis of stable isotopes and other data from regions where large changes are predicted to have occurred.",

In Germany, extremely hot temperatures were accompanied by extremely low precipitation, compounding the impacts. Here we investigate spring to autumn temperature and precipitation in Germany over the historical period. We show that since measurements started in 1881, Germany has never experienced as hot and dry conditions during March to November as in 2018. We analyse the rarity of the event and illustrate that estimates of return periods for such compound extreme events are extremely high but very uncertain and strongly depend on the way they are estimated. We further investigate output from an ensemble of climate model simulations (CMIP5). Most climate models represent the distributions of temperature and precipitation in Germany and their dependence relatively well. Statistical projections of the bivariate temperature-precipitation distribution suggests that a growing season such as 2018 will become less likely at warmer global mean temperatures due to slight increases in precipitation. In contrast, climate models project an increasing likelihood of a 2018-like event and much larger uncertainties both for temperature and precipitation at different warming levels. Both observation-based scaling and climate model estimates consistently project that the compound hot and dry conditions in peak summer June\u2013August become more likely. Overall, our results highlight the challenges associated with estimating the rarity of very extreme multivariate events and illustrate how consistent future changes in multivariate extremes can be estimated from observations only.",

         "abstract": "The effect of anthropogenic climate change in the ocean is challenging to project because atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) respond differently to forcing. This study focuses on changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), ocean heat content (\\$\\$\\backslashDelta\\$\\$OHC), and the spatial pattern of ocean dynamic sea level (\\$\\$\\backslashDelta \\backslashzeta\\$\\$). We analyse experiments following the FAFMIP protocol, in which AOGCMs are forced at the ocean surface with standardised heat, freshwater and momentum flux perturbations, typical of those produced by doubling \\$\\$\\backslashhbox \\CO\\\\_\\\\2\\\\\\$\\$. Using two new heat-flux-forced experiments, we find that the AMOC weakening is mainly caused by and linearly related to the North Atlantic heat flux perturbation, and further weakened by a positive coupled heat flux feedback. The quantitative relationships are model-dependent, but few models show significant AMOC change due to freshwater or momentum forcing, or to heat flux forcing outside the North Atlantic. AMOC decline causes warming at the South Atlantic-Southern Ocean interface. It does not strongly affect the global-mean vertical distribution of \\$\\$\\backslashDelta\\$\\$OHC, which is dominated by the Southern Ocean. AMOC decline strongly affects \\$\\$\\backslashDelta \\backslashzeta\\$\\$in the North Atlantic, with smaller effects in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific. The ensemble-mean \\$\\$\\backslashDelta \\backslashzeta\\$\\$and \\$\\$\\backslashDelta\\$\\$OHC patterns are mostly attributable to the heat added by the flux perturbation, with smaller effects from ocean heat and salinity redistribution. The ensemble spread, on the other hand, is largely due to redistribution, with pronounced disagreement among the AOGCMs.",

Most recent scenarios from integrated assessment models require large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies (NETs) to reach the 2 °C target. A recent analysis of NETs, including direct air capture, enhanced weathering, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation/deforestation, showed that all NETs have significant limits to implementation, including economic cost, energy requirements, land use, and water use. In this paper, I assess the potential for negative emissions from soil carbon sequestration and biochar addition to land, and also the potential global impacts on land use, water, nutrients, albedo, energy and cost. Results indicate that soil carbon sequestration and biochar have useful negative emission potential (each 0.7 GtCeq. yr−1) and that they potentially have lower impact on land, water use, nutrients, albedo, energy requirement and cost, so have fewer disadvantages than many NETs. Limitations of soil carbon sequestration as a NET centre around issues of sink saturation and reversibility. Biochar could be implemented in combination with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Current integrated assessment models do not represent soil carbon sequestration or biochar. Given the negative emission potential of SCS and biochar and their potential advantages compared to other NETs, efforts should be made to include these options within IAMs, so that their potential can be explored further in comparison with other NETs for climate stabilization.",

We examine the impacts of this Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), also referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), on climate in an ensemble of five coupled climate models at both low and high spatial resolution. We use a SST nudging scheme specified by the Coupled Model Intercomparision Project's Decadal Climate Prediction Project Component C (CMIP6 DCPP-C) to impose a persistent positive/negative phase of the AMV in the North Atlantic in coupled model simulations; SSTs are free to evolve outside this region. The large-scale seasonal mean response to the positive AMV involves widespread warming over Eurasia and the Americas, with a pattern of cooling over the Pacific Ocean similar to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), together with a northward displacement of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The accompanying changes in global atmospheric circulation lead to widespread changes in precipitation. We use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to demonstrate that this large-scale climate response is accompanied by significant differences between models in how they respond to the common AMV forcing, particularly in the tropics. These differences may arise from variations in North Atlantic air-sea heat fluxes between models despite a common North Atlantic SST forcing pattern. We cannot detect a widespread effect of increased model horizontal resolution in this climate response, with the exception of the ITCZ, which shifts further northwards in the positive phase of the AMV in the higher resolution configurations.",

Among cultivated species, the Hungarian BK-2 contains more chamazulene in its essential oil than the German Degumil type, which is mainly cultivated for its a-bisabolol. Both components have important antiinflammatory activities.\r\nWild populations can be easily distinguished from cultivated ones by their high amount of bisaboloides, particularly the flower of Hungarian Szabadkígyós wild type, which contained on average 48 % of the biologically active (-)-a-bisabolol. The population of Szabadkígyós has good salt tolerance which is important owing to global warming, because the proportion of saline areas is increasing worldwide.\r\nTo keep the genome of Szabadkígyós having high (-)-a-bisabolol content, Szőke and research team used biotechnological methods.\r\nSterile plantlets, were infected by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains #A-4, #15834, #R-1601. The hairy root clones possessing the best growing and biosynthetical potential were multiplied for phytochemical investigations. Pharmacologically important compounds of their essential oils were followed in great detail. The amount of in vitro cultured terpenoids and polyin compounds was compared with that of in vivo plants.\r\nGC-MS studies showed that sterile chamomile cultures generated the most important terpenoid and polyin compounds characteristics of the mother plant. Berkheyaradulene, geranyl-isovalerat and cedrol as new components were identified in these sterile cultures. The main component of hairy root cultures (D/400, D/1, D/100 and Sz/400) was tr-b-farnesene and in addition one new compound: a-selinene was identified. Hairy root culture originated from chamomile collected in Szabadkígyós was intensive increased the essential oil content and pharmacological active compounds: (-) -α-bisabolol and β-eudesmol was also synthetized in large quantity. Furthermore, in vitro organized cultures were made from this population to obtain propagation material containing numerous active substances.",

Variations on rainfall-streamflow relationships and seasonal crop yields significantly affect human development in this region and make local communities highly vulnerable to climate change and variability. We developed an expert-informed empirical statistical downscaling (ESD) algorithm to explore and construct robust global climate predictors to perform skillful RCP8.5 projections of in-situ March-May (MAM) precipitation required for impact modeling and adaptation studies. We applied our framework to a topographically-complex region of the Colombian Andes where a number of previous studies have reported El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as the main driver of climate variability. Supervised machine learning algorithms were trained with customized and bias-corrected predictors from NCEP reanalysis, and a cross-validation approach was implemented to assess both predictive skill and model selection. We found weak and not significant teleconnections between precipitation and lagged seasonal surface temperatures over El Niño3.4 domain, which suggests that ENSO fails to explain MAM rainfall variability in the study region. In contrast, series of Sea Level Pressure (SLP) over American Samoa -likely associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ)- explains more than 65% of the precipitation variance. The best prediction skill was obtained with Selected Generalized Additive Models (SGAM) given their ability to capture linear/nonlinear relationships present in the data. While SPCZ-related series exhibited a positive linear effect in the rainfall response, SLP predictors in the north Atlantic and central equatorial Pacific showed nonlinear effects. A multimodel (MIROC, CanESM2 and CCSM) ensemble of ESD projections revealed an increased variability and a positive and significant trend in the MAM precipitation mean in the next decades, with accentuated changes and projection uncertainty after 2050. ESD traces (2050-2100) from MIROC presented the highest changes in the precipitation mean ( 60%) when compared with the observations.",

Equilibrium sensitivity, including slower surface albedo feedbacks, is ~6°C for doubled CO2 for the range of climate states between glacial conditions and ice-free Antarctica. Decreasing CO2 was the main cause of a cooling trend that began 50 million years ago, the planet being nearly ice-free until CO2 fell to 450 ± 100 ppm; barring prompt policy changes, that critical level will be passed, in the opposite direction, within decades. If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that. The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes of non-CO2 forcings. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon. If the present overshoot of this target CO2 is not brief, there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects.",

         "pages": "1-15","abstract": "Climate extremes indices are evaluated for the northeast United States and adjacent Canada (Northeast) using gridded observations and twenty-three CMIP5 coupled models. Previous results have demonstrated observed increases in warm and wet extremes and decreases in cold extremes, consistent with changes expected in a warming world. Here, a significant shift is found in the distribution of observed total annual precipitation over 1981-2010. In addition, significant positive trends are seen in all observed wet precipitation indices over 1951-2010. For the Northeast region, CMIP5 models project significant shifts in the distributions of most temperature and precipitation indices by 2041-2070. By the late century, the coldest (driest) future extremes are projected to be warmer (wetter) than the warmest (wettest) extremes at present. The multimodel interquartile range compares well with observations, providing a measure of confidence in the projections in this region. Spatial analysis suggests that the largest increases in heavy precipitation extremes are projected for northern, coastal, and mountainous areas. Results suggest that the projected increase in total annual precipitation is strongly influenced by increases in winter wet extremes. The largest decreases in cold extremes are projected for northern and interior portions of the Northeast, while the largest increases in summer warm extremes are projected for densely populated southern, central, and coastal areas. This study provides a regional analysis and verification of the latest generation of CMIP global models specifically for the Northeast, useful to stakeholders focused on understanding and adapting to climate change and its impacts in the region.",

         "abstract": "This book covers a wide area of the atmospheric science, focusing particularly on those physical and dynamical aspects of our environment which tend to create heat sources and sinks in the earth-atmosphere system and which it seeks to balance through circulation at different time and space scales. The processes of heat transfer in the atmosphere and ocean by general circulation and by waves and oscillations are discussed in detail. The heat balance of the atmosphere is considered, after taking into consideration the role of various types of greenhouse gases that may be present. In this context, the publication of the book will be very timely and will be welcomed by all those interested in knowing more about our atmosphere and the way it works, especially with regard to the contentious issue of global warming by greenhouse gases released by human activities on earth.\n\nStarting with the origin, composition and structure of the atmosphere, the physics part deals with the laws of heat and thermodynamics of dry and moist air, water vapor and its transformation into different phases and formation of cloud and rain under different stability conditions, solar and terrestrial radiation and their impact on the gaseous envelope in different layers of the atmosphere which create sources and sinks in different parts of the atmosphere especially in its boundary layers. The dynamics part highlights the various types of motion systems including the general circulation of waves and oscillations which create the heat balance in the earth-atmosphere system.",

Biofuels are one of the many alternatives to Hydrocarbon fuels. This research evaluates the potential of biogas production using poultry wastes, yam, and plantain peels in a ratio of 2:1:1. The organic waste materials were crushed using a sterile mortar and pestle. It was weighed and mixed with distilled water in a sterile bowl and loaded in a bioreactor for 45 days. The proximate analysis was carried out to determine the nutrient composition of the samples using standard procedures. Microbiological analysis was carried out using both general- purpose and differential media before and after loading the samples in the bioreactor. The pH and the temperature were monitored as well. A flame meter was used to compare the quality of the gas produced with that of cooking gas. The percentage moisture content obtained was 21.31, 28.71 and 23.17, % crude protein (6.17, 5.98 and 7.17), % ash content (7.9, 4.37, 12.13), % fat content (2.13, 1.14, 7.24), %crude fiber (19.94, 14.36, 36.89), % carbohydrate (42.53, 39.06 and 13.12) and the calories value of (213.09, 196.43 and 146.36) for plantain peels, yam peels and poultry waste respectively. Three fungal isolates and nine bacterial isolates were obtained. Produced biogas constituted of 310, 1352, and 2264 ppm of Liquified Petroleum Gas, Carbon (II) Oxide, and Smoke respectively. The biogas was observed to be highly flammable and burnt with a bluish flame.",

We present a model framework that\r\ntreats galaxies as ensembles of HII and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) regions of\r\nvarying metallicities. These models are based upon empirical relations between\r\nline ratios and electron temperature for HII regions, and DIG strong-line ratio\r\nrelations from SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU data. Flux-weighting effects and DIG\r\ncontamination can significantly affect properties inferred from global galaxy\r\nspectra, biasing metallicity estimates by more than 0.3 dex in some cases. We\r\nuse observationally-motivated inputs to construct a model matched to typical\r\nlocal star-forming galaxies, and quantify the biases in strong-line ratios,\r\nelectron temperatures, and direct-method metallicities as inferred from global\r\ngalaxy spectra relative to the median values of the HII region distributions in\r\neach galaxy. We also provide a generalized set of models that can be applied to\r\nindividual galaxies or galaxy samples in atypical regions of parameter space.\r\nWe use these models to correct for the effects of flux-weighting and DIG\r\ncontamination in the local direct-method mass-metallicity and fundamental\r\nmetallicity relations, and in the mass-metallicity relation based on\r\nstrong-line metallicities. Future photoionization models of galaxy line\r\nemission need to include DIG emission and represent galaxies as ensembles of\r\nemitting regions with varying metallicity, instead of as single HII regions\r\nwith effective properties, in order to obtain unbiased estimates of key\r\nunderlying physical properties.",

This blocking anticyclone occurred in late October and early November of 1985. The data used were provided by the NASA Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres on a global 2.0° latitude by 2.5° longitude grid. The horizontal distribution of the atmospheric forcing mechanisms that were important to 500 mb block formation, maintenance and decay were examined. A scale-partitioned form of the Z\u2013O equation was then used to examine the relative importance of forcing on the planetary and synoptic scales, and their interactions. As seen in previous studies, the results presented here show that upper tropospheric anticyclonic vorticity advection was the most important contributor to block formation and maintenance. However, adiabatic warming, and vorticity tilting were also important at various times during the block lifetime. In association with precursor surface cyclogenesis, the 300 mb jet streak in the downstream (upstream) from a long-wave trough (ridge) amplified significantly. This strengthening of the jet streak enhanced the anticyclonic vorticity advection field that aided the amplification of a 500 mb short-wave ridge. The partitioned height tendency results demonstrate that the interactions between the planetary and synoptic-scale through vorticity advection was the most important contributor to block formation. Planetary-scale, synoptic-scale, and their interactions contributed weakly to the maintenance of the blocking anticyclone, with the advection of synoptic-scale vorticity by the planetary-scale flow playing a more important role. Planetary-scale decay of the long-wave ridge contributed to the demise of this blocking event.",

         "volume": "7","number": "6","pages": "815--833","abstract": "Solar geoengineering has been proposed as a means to cool the Earth by increasing the reflection of sunlight back to space, for example, by injecting reflective aerosol particles (or their precursors) into the lower stratosphere. Such proposed techniques would not be able to substitute for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a response to the risks of climate change, as they would only mask some of the effects of global warming. They might, however, eventually be applied as a complementary approach to reduce climate risks. Thus, the Earth system consequences of solar geoengineering are central to understanding its potentials and risks. Here we review the state-of-the-art knowledge about stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection and an idealized proxy for this, \u2018sunshade geoengineering,\u2019 in which the intensity of incoming sunlight is directly reduced in models. Studies are consistent in suggesting that sunshade geoengineering and stratospheric aerosol injection would generally offset the climate effects of elevated GHG concentrations. However, it is clear that a solar geoengineered climate would be novel in some respects, one example being a notably reduced hydrological cycle intensity. Moreover, we provide an overview of nonclimatic aspects of the response to stratospheric aerosol injection, for example, its effect on ozone, and the uncertainties around its consequences. We also consider the issues raised by the partial control over the climate that solar geoengineering would allow. Finally, this overview highlights some key research gaps in need of being resolved to provide sound basis for guidance of future decisions around solar geoengineering.

World Development Indicator states, the amounts of carbon emission in Malaysia are increasing at an uncontrollable rate especially near the end of Year 2014 with a rate of 8 metric tons per capita. This rate lead to the implementation of greener approach towards industrial sector which includes the construction industry. Green Building Index GBI is the green rating tool recognized by the Malaysian construction industry to promote sustainability in the built environment. It is developed specifically for the Malaysian tropical climate by Persatuan Arkitek Malaysia PAM and Association of Consulting Engineers Malaysia ACEM . Energy is becoming one of the most critical and important aspect to the nation, countries with high percentage of energy and resources is considered powerful as nowadays energy and resources of the country is key measurement for its power and development. The overall study indicated that there is an increase in sustainable construction in current Malaysian construction industry with respect to the GBI standards. This increase should be maintained to ensure all future buildings in Malaysia should follow the standards set by GBI. Kamil M. | Deepak T. J. | Shanti.

         "abstract": "In 1972 The Limits of Growth , sponsored by the Club of Rome and produced by a research team on a MIT computer programmed with a World3 model, created a stormy sensation. Denounced as eco-gloom and doom, the book also became a keystone of the era's environmentalism. Now on the eve of the June U.N. Earth Summit, three of the researchers give World3 another run. Although many books and reports examine \"sustainability,\" the authors provide unique insights thanks to their background in systems analysis. Society has gone into overshoot, they argue, a state of being beyond limits without knowing it. These limits are more like speed limits than barriers at the end of the road: the rate at which renewable resources can renew themselves, the rate at which we can change from nonrenewable resources to renewable ones, and the rate at which nature can recycle our pollution. Without being a catch-all on the environmental crisis, the book shows how we are overshooting such crucial resources as food and water while overwhelming nature with pollutants like those causing global warming. World3 runs 13 future scenarios and learns that we can only avoid collapse by unplugging the exponential growth in population (two billions people in the past 20 years) and industrial production (doubled in the past 20 years). If the world settles for two children per couple and the per capita income of South Korea, we can avoid collapse and find an equilibrium at 7.7 billion people through 2100. Systems analysis may sound like an academic specialty, but the authors have written for the general reader and provide a compelling challenge to traditional economics and public complacency.",

In many other areas there is no consensus among models on the sign of the projected change. This is often assumed to indicate that precipitation projections in these regions are highly uncertain. Here, twenty-first century precipitation projections under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario using 24 World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)/Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) climate models are examined. In areas with no consensus on the sign of projected change there are extensive subregions where the projected change is ?very likely? (i.e., probability > 0.90) to be small (relative to, e.g., the size of interannual variability during the late twentieth century) or zero. The statistical significance of and interrelationships between methods used to identify model consensus on projected change in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report are examined, and the impact of interdependency among model projections on statistical significance is investigated. Interdependency among projections is shown to be much weaker than interdependency among simulations of climatology. The results show that there is more widespread consistency among the model projections than one might infer from the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment report. This discovery highlights the broader need to identify regions, variables, and phenomena that are expected to be little affected by anthropogenic climate change and to communicate this information to the wider community. This is especially important for projections of climate for the next 1?3 decades.",

Here we used a biogeochemical model at ecosystem scale to estimate crop productivity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from bioenergy crops grown on marginal lands in the United States. Two broadly-tested cellulosic crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, were assumed to be grown on the abandoned land and mixed crop-vegetation land with marginal productivity. Production of biomass and biofuel as well as net carbon exchange and nitrous oxide emissions were estimated in a spatially explicit manner. We found that, cellulosic crops, especially Miscanthus could produce a considerable amount of biomass, and the effective ethanol yield is high on these marginal lands. For every hectare of marginal land, switchgrass and Miscanthus could produce 1.0-2.3 kL and 2.9-6.9 kL ethanol, respectively, depending on nitrogen fertilization rate and biofuel conversion efficiency. Nationally, both crop systems act as net GHG sources. Switchgrass has high global warming intensity (100-390 g CO2eq L−1 ethanol), in terms of GHG emissions per unit ethanol produced. Miscanthus, however, emits only 21-36 g CO2eq to produce every liter of ethanol. To reach the mandated cellulosic ethanol target in the United States, growing Miscanthus on the marginal lands could potentially save land and reduce GHG emissions in comparison to growing switchgrass. However, the ecosystem modeling is still limited by data availability and model deficiencies, further efforts should be made to classify crop-specific marginal land availability, improve model structure and better integrate ecosystem modeling into life cycle assessment.

In excellent agreement with one published study, we find that k(1)(T) = 9.0 x 10(-11) exp (+98/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and that the reactive quenching rate coefficient is k(1b) (5.8 +/- 2.3) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) independent of temperature. We find that k(2)(T) = 2.0 x 10(-11) exp (+52/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) with reaction proceeding almost entirely (similar to 99%) by reactive quenching. Reactive quenching of O(D-1) by NF3 is more than a factor of two faster than reported in one published study, a result that will significantly lower the model-derived atmospheric lifetime and global warming potential of NF3. Deactivation of O(D-1) by SF5CF3 is slow enough (k(3) < 2.0 x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K) that reaction with O(D-1) is unimportant as an atmospheric removal mechanism for SF5CF3. The kinetics of O(D-1) reactions with SO2 (k(4)) and CS2 (k(5)) have also been investigated at 298 K. We find that k(4) = (2.2 +/- 0.3) x 10(-10) and k(5) = (4.6 +/- 0.6) x 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1); branching ratios for reactive quenching are 0.76 +/- 0.12 and 0.94 +/- 0.06 for the SO2 and CS2 reactions, respectively. All uncertainties reported above are estimates of accuracy (2 sigma) and rate coefficients k(i) (T) (i = 1; 2) calculated from the above Arrhenius expressions have estimated accuracies of +15% (2 sigma).",

It was expected that the production of cement would be increased from about from 1.5 billion tons in 1995 to 2.2 billion tons in 2020. But 2018 china using 2.37 billion tons individually. India is the second largest producer of cement in the world. Cement industry is expected to reach 550 â\u20AC\u201C 600 million tons per annum at 2025. The cement production contributes nearly 8 of worlds global warming due to emission of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, to the atmosphere. Hence, it is essential to find a substitute material for cement. The technology geopolymer concrete found as alternative for this problem. In this present research, cement is replaced with Fly Ash and GGBS in different percentages with steel fibers. The studies show that the load carrying capacity of most of the gpc mix was in the most cases more than that of conventional ordinary Portland cement concrete mix. The fresh and hardened properties of geopolymer concrete were found with and without steel fiber. The mechanical characteristics of all the examined mixes are to be enhanced by the GGBS content, in both plain and steel fibre reinforced geopolymer concrete. A comparative analysis has been carried out for normal conventional concrete to that of the steel fibre reinforced geopolymer concrete under ambient curing in relation to compressive, split tensile, flexural strengths. As the fibre content generally increases compressive, split tensile and flexural strengths are proportionally increased. G. Jegatheeswaran | K.

The number of components in the mixture is obtained using order statistics of the mixing proportions, hence avoiding previous difficulties related to sample sizes and independence issues. The method is first applied to a few low-order stochastic dynamical systems and data from a general circulation model. The method is next applied to winter daily 500-hPa heights from 1949 to 2003 over the Northern Hemisphere. A spatial clustering algorithm is first applied to the leading two principal components (PCs) and shows significant clustering. The clustering is particularly robust for the first half of the record and less for the second half. The mixture model is then used to identify the clusters. Two highly significant extratropical planetary-scale preferred structures are obtained within the first two to four EOF state space. The first pattern shows a Pacific?North American (PNA) pattern and a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the second pattern is nearly opposite to the first one. It is also observed that some subspaces show multivariate Gaussianity, compatible with linearity, whereas others show multivariate non-Gaussianity. The same analysis is also applied to two subperiods, before and after 1978, and shows a similar regime behavior, with a slight stronger support for the first subperiod. In addition a significant regime shift is also observed between the two periods as well as a change in the shape of the distribution. The patterns associated with the regime shifts reflect essentially a PNA pattern and an NAO pattern consistent with the observed global warming effect on climate and the observed shift in sea surface temperature around the mid-1970s.",

The Infrastructure development has increased the demand of cement and fine aggregates. The cement production industry creates environmental problems such as pollution and global warming due to emission of various hazardous gases. And natural sand is expensive and not available easily so overcome these problems researches are more focusing towards utilizing agricultural and industrial waste material. Sugarcane Bagasse Ash (SCBA) is left-over industrial byproduct from sugar factory's captive power plant which is used for partial replacement of cement and Groundnut Shells (GS) are agricultural waste product which is used for partial replacement of sand. In this paper SCBA has been chemically and physically categorized and partially replaced in the ratio of 2% & 5% by weight of cement and Crushed Groundnut Shells partially replaced in fixed ratio of 5% by weight of fine aggregates in M25 grade concrete mix. There are total of 36 specimens of the Combination of SCBA and GS /OPC concrete cubes of 150 mm size were tested for compressive strength at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after immersed curing. The results show that the compressive strengths of the standard mix and those of other percentage combinations increases with curing age but decreases with increased SCBA and GS percentage. It can be concluded that the satisfactory concrete with replacement of 5% of SCBA and 5% replacement of GS content. Prof. K. U.

Several consistent changes were observed across all four realizations for the seasonal means: robust increase of U10 and Hs in the Southern Ocean for both the austral summer and winter due to the poleward shift of the jet stream; a dipole pattern of the U10 and Hs with increases in the northeast sector and decreases at the midlatitude during boreal winter in the North Atlantic due to the more frequent occurrence of the positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); and strong decrease of U10 and Hs in the tropical western Pacific Ocean during austral summer, which might be caused by the joint effect of the weakening of the Walker circulation and the large hurricane frequency decrease in the South Pacific. Changes of the 99th percentile U10 and Hs are twice as strong as changes in the seasonal means, and the maximum changes are mainly dominated by the changes in hurricanes. Robust strong decreases of U10 and Hs in the South Pacific are obtained because of the large hurricane frequency decrease, while the results in the Northern Hemisphere basins differ among the models. An additional sensitivity experiment suggests that the qualitative response of U10 and Hs is not affected by using SST anomalies only and maintaining the radiative forcing unchanged (using 1980 values), as in this study.",

Partially migratory populations are populations that consist of both migratory and residential individuals. Such populations are very common, yet their stability has long been debated. The inheritance of migratory activity is currently best described by the threshold model of quantitative genetics. The inclusion of such a genetic threshold model for migratory behavior leads to a stable zone in time and space of partially migratory populations under a wide range of demographic parameter values, when assuming stable environmental conditions and unlimited genetic diversity. Migratory species are expected to be particularly sensitive to global warming, as arrival at the breeding grounds might be increasingly mistimed as a result of the uncoupling of long-used cues and actual environmental conditions, with decreasing reproduction as a consequence. Here, we investigate the consequences for migratory behavior and the stability of partially migratory populations under five climate change scenarios and the assumption of a genetic threshold value for migratory behavior in an individual-based model. The results show a spatially and temporally stable zone of partially migratory populations after different lengths of time in all scenarios. In the scenarios in which the species expands its range from a particular set of starting populations, the genetic diversity and location at initialization determine the species\u2019 colonization speed across the zone of partial migration and therefore across the entire landscape. Abruptly changing environmental conditions after model initialization never caused a qualitative change in phenotype distributions, or complete extinction. This suggests that climate change-induced shifts in species\u2019 ranges as well as changes in survival probabilities and reproductive success can be met with flexibility in migratory behavior at the species level, which will reduce the risk of extinction.",

         "abstract": "Aviation alters the composition of the atmosphere globally and can thus drive climate change and ozone depletion. The last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. Here, a comprehensive updated assessment of aviation is provided. Scientific advances since the 1999 assessment have reduced key uncertainties, sharpening the quantitative evaluation, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The climate impact of aviation is driven by long-term impacts from CO2 emissions and shorter-term impacts from non-CO2 emissions and effects, which include the emissions of water vapour, particles and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The present-day radiative forcing from aviation (2005) is estimated to be 55 mW m−2 (excluding cirrus cloud enhancement), which represents some 3.5\\% (range 1.3\u201310\\%, 90\\% likelihood range) of current anthropogenic forcing, or 78 mW m−2 including cirrus cloud enhancement, representing 4.9\\% of current forcing (range 2\u201314\\%, 90\\% likelihood range). According to two SRES-compatible scenarios, future forcings may increase by factors of 3\u20134 over 2000 levels, in 2050. The effects of aviation emissions of CO2 on global mean surface temperature last for many hundreds of years (in common with other sources), whilst its non-CO2 effects on temperature last for decades. Much progress has been made in the last ten years on characterizing emissions, although major uncertainties remain over the nature of particles. Emissions of NOx result in production of ozone, a climate warming gas, and the reduction of ambient methane (a cooling effect) although the overall balance is warming, based upon current understanding. These NOx emissions from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite the progress made on modelling aviation's impacts on tropospheric chemistry, there remains a significant spread in model results. The knowledge of aviation's impacts on cloudiness has also improved: a limited number of studies have demonstrated an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the magnitude varies: however, these trend analyses may be impacted by satellite artefacts. The effect of aviation particles on clouds (with and without contrails) may give rise to either a positive forcing or a negative forcing: the modelling and the underlying processes are highly uncertain, although the overall effect of contrails and enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could be substantial, compared with other effects. The debate over quantification of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs. Current studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to determine optimal technological development paths, which is an aspect that atmospheric science has much to contribute. In terms of alternative fuels, liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some of aviation's impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon-neutral way: such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a 'hydrogen economy' develops. The introduction of biofuels as a means of reducing CO2 impacts represents a future possibility. However, even over and above land-use concerns and greenhouse gas budget issues, aviation fuels require strict adherence to safety standards and thus require extra processing compared with biofuels destined for other sectors, where the uptake of such fuel may be more beneficial in the first instance.",

We\r\nderive gas-phase oxygen abundances using two widely adopted metallicity\r\ncalibrations based on the OIII/Hbeta, NII/Halpha and NII/OII line\r\nratios. The two derived metallicity gradients are usually in good agreement\r\nwithin +/-0.14 dex/R25 (R25 is the B-band iso-photoal radius), but the\r\nmetallicity gradients can differ significantly when the ionisation parameters\r\nchange systematically with radius. We investigate the metallicity gradients as\r\na function of stellar mass (8<log(M*/Msun)<11) and absolute B-band luminosity\r\n(-16 > MB > -22). When the metallicity gradients are expressed in dex/kpc, we\r\nshow that galaxies with lower mass and luminosity, on average, have steeper\r\nmetallicity gradients. When the metallicity gradients are expressed in dex/R25,\r\nwe find no correlation between the metallicity gradients, and stellar mass and\r\nluminosity. We provide a local benchmark metallicity gradient of field\r\nstar-forming galaxies useful for comparison with studies at high redshifts. We\r\ninvestigate the origin of the local benchmark gradient using simple chemical\r\nevolution models and observed gas and stellar surface density profiles in\r\nnearby field spiral galaxies. Our models suggest that the local benchmark\r\ngradient is a direct result of the coevolution of gas and stellar disk under\r\nvirtually closed-box chemical evolution when the stellar-to-gas mass ratio\r\nbecomes high (>>0.3). These models imply low current mass accretion rates\r\n(<0.3xSFR), and low mass outflow rates (<3xSFR) in local field star-forming\r\ngalaxies.",

Due to shortage of diesel fuel and its increasing cost as well as hazardous emission emitted by diesel engine, the use of biodiesel and its blends has gained importance over the past two decades due to its environmental and economic benefits. Many countries are evaluating a variety of alternative fuels for use in motor vehicles in an attempt to reduce greenhouse emissions, global warming and to improve the energy security of the nations. Blended fuel is a replacement for the diesel fuel in CI engines due to its significant environmental benefits. The use of blended fuel leads to reduction in particulate matter, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions that decrease in fuel consumption and the nitrous oxide emission on diesel engine without any modification. The addition of Nano particles with blended diesel fuel increases the efficiency and decreases the emissions. Metal oxides such as alumina, titanium oxide, cerium oxide in the form of nano particles can be used to increase the efficiency as well as to decrease emission. In this review paper work has been done to demonstrate the effect of various nanoparticles added diesel and biodiesel on performance and emission characteristics of CI engine. Abinesh. R | Abihnav.

It explores the standardization model (e.g. global, glocal, local, and single case strategy) by examining the international advertising strategies that multinational corporations (MNCs) from North America, Europe, and Asia used in their advertising campaigns targeting two culturally different markets: the United States and China. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A content analysis of 210 print advertisements compares the extent of standardization in creative strategy and execution across product country of origin (Japan, Korea, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States). Western versus non\u2010Western cultural cues are also coded and examined. Findings \u2013 Overall, MNCs are more likely to adopt the glocal strategy than any other strategies in their international campaigns. Specifically, EU\u2010based MNCs tend to pursue the global strategy, whereas the North America\u2010based MNCs seem to favor the glocal strategy and Asia\u2010based MNCs tend to use local strategy. Western and non\u2010Western cultural values are found to manifest in the American and Chinese ads similarly, indicating a trend of increasing similarity in international advertising in face of global consumer culture. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The results of this content analysis provide a fuller picture in understanding the long\u2010standing issues of standardization in international advertising because of an approach to analyze creative strategy separately from execution. However, content analysis is inherently limited in inferring causality between observed patterns and mechanisms/variables that account for the patterns. Also, the time frame for sample selection, which is set as a year prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, is another limitation of the study. Practical implications \u2013 There is an ongoing trend of using \u201Cone\u2010creative, multiple\u2010execution\u201D strategy in international advertising. MNCs may distinguish advertising creative strategy from execution when developing their international advertising campaigns. Originality/value \u2013 First, this study addresses the issue with a clear conceptual definition of standardization and differentiates the strategic and tactic standardization. Second, this is the first attempt to explore the standardization model using a sample of 51 multinational brands from North America, Europe, and Asia. The authors find that MNCs are practicing some standardization advertising strategy, but to varying degrees. Third, this study identifies and empirically tests two external factors \u2013 culture and convergence of external markets \u2013 that influence standardization.",

Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO2 rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO2, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta-analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta-analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO2 on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta-analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta-analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO2 on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta-analysis, suggesting the continued need for long-term experiments.",

Three types of lipped channel cross section profile have been chosen for the study, using CUFSM software by trial and error method to obtain local/global interaction. A non-linear finite element model is developed and verified against the experimental data available in literature on cold-formed steel lipped channel columns. Geometric and material non-linearities are included in the finite element model. Static buckling analysis is carried out and buckling modes such as local and distortional are extracted to incorporate the initial imperfections. After the verification of the finite element model extensive parametric study have been carried out by varying the length and thickness. The finite Element Software ABAQUS is used for the study. The column strengths predicted by the finite element analysis are compared with the design column strengths predicted by DSM - AS100:2007, AS/NZ: 4600- 2005. Based on this study the influence of local/global interaction on ultimate strength are discussed and presented.",

In this paper we present the innovative methods and experiences from several years of teaching practical and global SW engineering at the Computer Science Departments of San Francisco State University (SFSU), USA in conjunction with the University of Applied Sciences, Fulda University, Germany. We also provide analysis and evaluation of class effectiveness based on several assessment methods including extensive student questionnaires, with our recommendations for teaching such SE classes. Our approach was to combine and synchronize class teaching about SW engineering methods and processes with actual SW development work in a setting designed to simulate a small SW company. Students were divided in \"local\" groups of 4-6 members, each group forming small SW \"companies\" in charge of developing a complete working WWW application as a final class project. Several smaller groups of students at SFSU were paired with groups of students at Fulda University, whom they never met face to face, to form \"global\" groups, thus simulating global SW engineering in a realistic setting. Students developed their final project incorporating five well-defined milestones typical for full SW development lifecycle. Instructors spent considerable time supervising and interacting with student \"companies\" in the role of company customers, CTO and VPs of engineering, marketing and sales. All student groups (including global ones) were able to produce impressive final project applications and provided very positive feedback for this class.",

Despite decades of study and broad public interest, we know little about the genetic basis of these hallmark traits. Here we uncover the history of the monarch/'s evolutionary origin and global dispersal, characterize the genes and pathways associated with migratory behaviour, and identify the discrete genetic basis of warning colouration by sequencing 101 Danaus genomes from around the globe. The results rewrite our understanding of this classic system, showing that D. plexippus was ancestrally migratory and dispersed out of North America to occupy its broad distribution. We find the strongest signatures of selection associated with migration centre on flight muscle function, resulting in greater flight efficiency among migratory monarchs, and that variation in monarch warning colouration is controlled by a single myosin gene not previously implicated in insect pigmentation.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS","abstract": "Negative feedback from accreting supermassive black holes is regarded as a\r\nkey ingredient in suppressing star formation and quenching massive galaxies.\r\nHowever, several models and observations suggest that black hole feedback may\r\nhave a positive effect, triggering star formation by compressing interstellar\r\nmedium gas to higher densities. We investigate the dual role of black hole\r\nfeedback using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback In\r\nRealistic Environments (FIRE) project, including a novel implementation of\r\nhyper-refined accretion-disc winds. Focusing on a massive, star-forming galaxy\r\nat $z 2$ ($M_halo 10^12.5 \\, M_ødot$), we show that\r\nstrong quasar winds with kinetic power $\\sim$10$^46$ erg/s acting for\r\n$>$20$\\,$Myr drive the formation of a central gas cavity and can dramatically\r\nreduce the star formation rate surface density across the galaxy disc. The\r\nsuppression of star formation is primarily driven by reducing the amount of gas\r\nthat can become star-forming, compared to directly evacuating the pre-existing\r\nstar-forming gas reservoir (preventive feedback dominates over ejective\r\nfeedback). Despite the global negative impact of quasar winds, we identify\r\nseveral plausible signatures of local positive feedback, including: (1) spatial\r\nanti-correlation of wind-dominated regions and star-forming clumps, (2) higher\r\nlocal star formation efficiency in compressed gas near the edge of the cavity,\r\nand (3) increased local contribution of outflowing material to star formation.\r\nStars forming under the presence of quasar winds tend to do so at larger radial\r\ndistances. Our results suggest that positive and negative AGN feedback can\r\ncoexist in galaxies, but local positive triggering of star formation plays a\r\nminor role in global galaxy growth.",

We show that star-forming galaxies at high redshift ( z > 1.5) are consistent with a model in which the interstellar medium conditions are more extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of local galaxies. We speculate that global spectra of our high-redshift galaxies may be dominated by H II regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-forming complexes in the Antennae and M82. The transition to local-type conditions occurs between 0.8 < z < 1.5. We conclude that classification schemes developed for local samples should not be applied at high redshift ( z ≥ 1.5). We use our theoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line that utilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios O III /Hβ and N II /Hα. Our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies from active galactic nuclei (AGN) between z = 0 to z ~ 3.5. We anticipate that our redshift-dependent optical classification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We apply our classification line to a sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z ~ 2.5. Although limited by small numbers, we show that our classification line is consistent with the position of AGN that have been independently confirmed via other methods.",

We first identified the Little Cub as a\r\ncandidate metal-poor galaxy based on its Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric\r\ncolors, combined with spectroscopy using the Kast spectrograph on the Shane 3-m\r\ntelescope at Lick Observatory. In this letter, we present high-quality\r\nspectroscopic data taken with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer at Keck\r\nObservatory, which confirm the extremely metal-poor nature of this galaxy.\r\nBased on the weak O III 4363 Angstrom emission line, we estimate a direct\r\noxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.13 +/- 0.08, making the Little Cub one of\r\nthe lowest metallicity star-forming galaxies currently known in the local\r\nUniverse. The Little Cub appears to be a companion of the spiral galaxy NGC\r\n3359 and shows evidence of gas stripping. We may therefore be witnessing the\r\nquenching of a near-pristine galaxy as it makes its first passage about a Milky\r\nWay-like galaxy.",

The higher authorities of all the countries or nations encourage the society through a proper way likewise seminars, conferences, printed media, etc to utilize the renewable energy resources in a predetermined manner. Global warming also is a big concern for our mankind, we need to step up as early as possible in order to utilize natural resources so that we can get more and more benefits, but care must be taken in order to preserve our atmosphere. It has been found that renewable energy has recorded the most significant development around the globe. According to the survey report, about 24 of the world\u2019s electricity is produced by Renewable Energy resources, this implies that about Â¼ th part of electricity is generated from REs\u2019s whereas 76 of latest renewable installation goes in favor of photovoltaic PV and wind turbine WT systems. Efforts are being made towards research on hybrid renewable resources that are used for purpose of microgrids. Renewable based microgrids DC proposes a characteristic feature of utilizing natural resources with the help of energy management techniques. Stringent control is needed for hybrid type microgrids such as wind and PV based for harnessing maximum available energy, energy storage system like batteries demands efficient management and the DC bus voltage should remain constant. These above based requirements are fulfilled by the MPPT control algorithm in our project, so it provides intelligence to the system and makes the microgrids reliable.

Objective comparisons between model and observations were conducted on 2\u2009months of data. An objective method was used to determine 'storm'/'no storm' in the model forecasts. These were then compared against cloud top temperature from IR satellite and lightning data from the arrival time difference (ATD) radio ground network to determine whether each model was successful at forecasting storm/calm events.

Objective comparisons between model and observations were conducted on 2\u2009months of data. An objective method was used to determine \u2018storm\u2019/\u2018no storm\u2019 in the model forecasts. These were then compared against cloud top temperature from IR satellite and lightning data from the arrival time difference (ATD) radio ground network to determine whether each model was successful at forecasting storm/calm events. The 4\u2009km model was able to capture more storm hits (thus had fewer storm misses), but also gained more false alarm events. Overall, the objective analysis showed that both models had some predictive skill and both were an improvement on a persistence forecast.",

Such large environmental changes are already having profound impacts on the flora, fauna, and inhabitants of the Arctic region. An open question, however, is whether these Arctic changes have an effect on the jet-stream and thereby influence weather patterns farther south. This broad question has recently received a lot of scientific and media attention, but conclusions appear contradictory rather than consensual. We argue that one point of confusion has arisen due to ambiguities in the exact question being posed. In this study, we frame our inquiries around three distinct questions: Can Arctic warming influence the midlatitude jet-stream? Has Arctic warming significantly influenced the midlatitude jet-stream? Will Arctic warming significantly influence the midlatitude jet-stream? We argue that framing the discussion around the three questions: Can it?, Has it?, and Will it? provides insight into the common themes emerging in the literature as well as highlights the challenges ahead.

In the post-genomic era, it is possible to measure the \"phylophenetic\" contents of different pathways topologies from a global perspective.RESULTS:We reconstructed phylophenetic trees for all available metabolic pathways based on topological similarities, and compared them to the corresponding 16S rRNA-based trees. Similarity values for each pair of trees ranged from 0.044 to 0.297. Using the quartet method, single pathways trees were merged into a comprehensive tree containing information from a large part of the entire metabolic networks. This tree showed considerably higher similarity (0.386) to the corresponding 16S rRNA-based tree than any tree based on a single pathway, but was, on the other hand, sufficiently distinct to preserve unique phylogenetic information not reflected by the 16S rRNA tree.CONCLUSION:We observed that the topology of different metabolic pathways provided different phylogenetic and phenetic information, depicting the compromise between phylogenetic information and varying evolutionary pressures forming metabolic pathway topologies in different organisms. The phylogenetic information content of the comprehensive tree is substantially higher than that of any tree based on a single pathway, which also gave clues to constraints working on the topology of the global metabolic networks, information that is only partly reflected by the topologies of individual metabolic pathways.",

However, privacy considerations and the sheer scale of\ndata available online are quickly making global monitoring infeasible, and\nexisting methods do not take full advantage of local network structure to\nidentify key nodes for monitoring. Here, we develop a model of the contagious\nspread of information in a global-scale, publicly-articulated social network\nand show that a simple method can yield not just early detection, but advance\nwarning of contagious outbreaks. In this method, we randomly choose a small\nfraction of nodes in the network and then we randomly choose a \"friend\" of each\nnode to include in a group for local monitoring. Using six months of data from\nmost of the full Twittersphere, we show that this friend group is more central\nin the network and it helps us to detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel\nhashtags about 7 days earlier than we could with an equal-sized randomly chosen\ngroup. Moreover, the method actually works better than expected due to network\nstructure alone because highly central actors are both more active and exhibit\nincreased diversity in the information they transmit to others. These results\nsuggest that local monitoring is not just more efficient, it is more effective,\nand it is possible that other contagious processes in global-scale networks may\nbe similarly monitored.",

Through this new, shared model of meaning-making, and by re-framing our museum collections in a highly connected, global world, online collaborative learning offers museums and visitors new possibilities for learning, both in small, \"narrowcast\" groups and also at the larger institutional level. As digital artifacts are created and improved by co-experts working together online toward a common goal, the larger public may benefit from a shared content model, or \"digital commons,\" thus shifting museums from their roles as cultural competitors toward a new model of cultural collaborators. Includes extensive case studies and practical advice for museum educators.\"--Publisher.",

         "volume": "81","number": "1","pages": "71-95","abstract": "This paper presents an overview of changes in the extreme events that are most likely to affect Europe in forthcoming decades. A variety of diagnostic methods are used to determine how heat waves, heavy precipitation, drought, wind storms, and storm surges change between present (1961\u201390) and future (2071\u20132100) climate on the basis of regional climate model simulations produced by the PRUDENCE project. A summary of the main results follows. Heat waves \u2013 Regional surface warming causes the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves to increase over Europe. By the end of the twenty first century, countries in central Europe will experience the same number of hot days as are currently experienced in southern Europe. The intensity of extreme temperatures increases more rapidly than the intensity of more moderate temperatures over the continental interior due to increases in temperature variability. Precipitation \u2013 Heavy winter precipitation increases in central and northern Europe and decreases in the south; heavy summer precipitation increases in north-eastern Europe and decreases in the south. Mediterranean droughts start earlier in the year and last longer. Winter storms \u2013 Extreme wind speeds increase between 45°N and 55°N, except over and south of the Alps, and become more north-westerly than cuurently. These changes are associated with reductions in mean sea-level pressure, leading to more North Sea storms and a corresponding increase in storm surges along coastal regions of Holland, Germany and Denmark, in particular. These results are found to depend to different degrees on model formulation. While the responses of heat waves are robust to model formulation, the magnitudes of changes in precipitation and wind speed are sensitive to the choice of regional model, and the detailed patterns of these changes are sensitive to the choice of the driving global model. In the case of precipitation, variation between models can exceed both internal variability and variability between different emissions scenarios.",

         "volume": "5","number": "4","pages": "411--421","abstract": "The microclimate in facilities for studying effects of elevated CO2 on crops differs from ambient conditions. Open-top chambers (OTCs) increase temperature by 1\u20133 °C. If temperature and CO2 interact in their effect on crops, this would limit the value of OTC experiments. Furthermore, interaction of CO2 and temperature deserves study because increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration are expected to cause global warming. This paper describes two experiments in which a recently developed cooling system for OTCs was used to analyse the effects of temperature on photosynthesis, growth and yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Minaret). Two levels of CO2 were used (350 and 700 ppm), and two levels of temperature, with cooled OTCs being 1.6\u20132.4 °C colder than noncooled OTCs. Photosynthetic rates were increased by elevated CO2, but no effect of temperature was found. Cross-switching CO2 concentrations as well as determination of A\u2013Ci curves showed that plant photosynthetic capacity after anthesis acclimated to elevated CO2. The acclimation may be related to the effects of CO2 on tissue composition: elevated CO2 decreased leaf nitrogen concentrations and increased sugar content. Calculations of the seasonal mean crop light-use efficiency (LUE) were consistent with the photosynthesis data in that CO2 increased LUE by 20\\% on average whereas temperature had no effect. Both elevating CO2 and cooling increased grain yield, by an average of 11\\% and 23\\%, respectively. CO2 and temperature stimulated yield via different mechanisms: CO2 increased photosynthetic rate, but decreased crop light interception capacity (LAI), whereas cooling increased grain yield by increasing LAI and extending the growing season with 10 days. The effects of CO2 and temperature were not additive: the CO2 effect was about doubled in the noncooled open-top chambers. In most cases, effects on yield were mediated through increased grain density rather than increased individual grain weights. The higher growth response to elevated CO2 in noncooled vs. cooled OTCs shows that a cooling system may remove a bias towards overestimating crop growth response to CO2 in open-top chambers.",

In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.",

         "pages": "207--244","abstract": "The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification depends significantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.",

The conventional strategy for controlling the error in finite element methods is based on a posteriori estimates for the error in the global energy or L 2-norm involving local residuals of the computed solution. Such estimates contain constants describing the local approximation properties of the finite element spaces and the stability properties of a linearized dual problem. The mesh refinement then aims at the equilibration of the local error indicators. However, meshes generated via controlling the error in a global norm may not be appropriate for local error quantities like point values or line integrals and in case of strongly varying coefficients. This deficiency may be overcome by introducing certain weight-factors in the a posteriori error estimates which depend on the dual solution and contain information about the relevant error propagation. This way, optimally economical meshes may be generated for various kinds of error measures. This is systematically developed first for a simple model case and then illustrated by results for more complex problems in fluid mechanics, elasto-plasticity and radiative transfer.",

It also evaluates the macroeconomic implications of the climate mitigation policy. The analysis is carried out using the global hybrid TIAM-MACRO model. The major findings show that a rapid decarbonisation of all sectors in the global energy system is fundamental in achieving a 1.5 °C consistent goal. This requires a portfolio of supply-side and demand-side mitigation measures. While technological measures are essential to meet the decarbonisation target, reducing energy-service demands is found to be a mitigation measure that facilitates a cost-effective transition. In addition, energy-service demands reductions play an important role in offsetting the macroeconomic impacts of the climate policy. Finally, any overshoot of the energy sector carbon budget must be counterbalanced by a significant deployment of negative emissions technologies.",

Such renewable energy sources like wind solar hydro based energies etc. are environment friendly and have potential to be more widely used. Combining these renewable energy sources with back up units to form a hybrid system can provide a more economic environment friendly and reliable supply of electricity in all load demand conditions compared to single use of such systems. Energy storages Systems ESS present many benefits such as balancing generation and demand power quality improvement smoothing the renewable resource's intermittency and enabling ancillary services like frequency and voltage regulation in microgrid MG operation. Hybrid energy storage systems HESSs characterized by coupling of two or more energy storage technologies are emerged as a solution to achieve the desired performance by combining the appropriate features of different technologies. A single ESS technology cannot fulfill the desired operation due to its limited capability and potency in terms of lifespan cost energy and power density and dynamic response. Hence different configurations of HESSs considering storage type interface control method and the provided service have been proposed in the literature. This paper comprehensively reviews the state of the art of HESSs system for MG applications and presents a general outlook of developing HESS industry. Important aspects of HESS utilization in MGs including capacity sizing methods power converter topologies for HESS interface architecture controlling and energy management of HESS in MGs are reviewed and classified. An economic analysis along with design methodology is also included to point out the HESS from investor and distribution systems engineers view. Regarding literature review and available shortcomings future trends of HESS in MGs are proposed.

The root problem is greenhouse gas emissions, and the fundamental solution is curbing those emissions. Climate geoengineering has often been considered to be a \"last-ditch\" response to climate change, to be used only if climate change damage should produce extreme hardship. Although the likelihood of eventually needing to resort to these efforts grows with every year of inaction on emissions control, there is a lack of information on these ways of potentially intervening in the climate system. As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses albedo modification - changing the fraction of incoming solar radiation that reaches the surface. This approach would deliberately modify the energy budget of Earth to produce a cooling designed to compensate for some of the effects of warming associated with greenhouse gas increases. The prospect of large-scale albedo modification raises political and governance issues at national and global levels, as well as ethical concerns. Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth discusses some of the social, political, and legal issues surrounding these proposed techniques. It is far easier to modify Earth's albedo than to determine whether it should be done or what the consequences might be of such an action. One serious concern is that such an action could be unilaterally undertaken by a small nation or smaller entity for its own benefit without international sanction and regardless of international consequences. Transparency in discussing this subject is critical. In the spirit of that transparency, Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth was based on peer-reviewed literature and the judgments of the authoring committee; no new research was done as part of this study and all data and information used are from entirely open sources. By helping to bring light to this topic area, this book will help leaders to be far more knowledgeable about the consequences of albedo modification approaches before they face a decision whether or not to use them.\"--",

Energy is the key factor for social and economic developments in today scenario. Now a day\u2019s global warming is the main problem of developing counties, due to the nonstop combustion of fossil fuels all over the world, creating environmental hazards and reducing conventional energy sources. This scenario is contributing to the need to search for an new renewable source of energy, which is clean and available in excess. Due to the huge impetus in the government policies on the development of solar energy, it is acting as a main alternative renewable energy source. The solar energy is popular due to easy maintenance, cleanliness, sustainability, and zero noise characteristics. Therefore, Photo Voltaic module supplying loads with and without Maximum Power Point Technique MPPT is applied in the current studies to find the best results. Since the Photovoltaic array output is known to be affected by radiation of sun and temperature, which makes is compulsory to find out an effective method to draw out maximum power from Photo Voltaic cell modules. In my work, Perturb and Observe PandO algorithm is selected because of its easy implementation Solar energy is the clean and eternal source of energy till the end of the world. In this paper main focus is how to improve the efficiency of solar based power generation .Solar energy is variable depends upon the time and the atmospheric condition and hence output of the solar cell is directly proportional to the insulation level and inversely proportional to cell temperature and also the cell never operates at maximum power.

Our analysis includes three disc models\r\nwith gas surface densities ranging from Milky Way-like galaxies to gas-rich\r\nultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and two different SN driving schemes\r\n(random and correlated with local gas density). In order to isolate the physics\r\nof SN feedback, we do not include additional feedback processes. We find that,\r\nin these local box calculations, SN feedback excites relatively low\r\nmass-weighted gas turbulent velocity dispersions ~3-7 km/s and low wind mass\r\nloading factors <1 in all the cases we study. The low turbulent velocities and\r\nwind mass loading factors predicted by our local box calculations are\r\nsignificantly below those suggested by observations of gas-rich and rapidly\r\nstar-forming galaxies; they are also in tension with global simulations of disc\r\ngalaxies regulated by stellar feedback. Using a combination of numerical tests\r\nand analytic arguments, we argue that local Cartesian boxes cannot predict the\r\nproperties of galactic winds because they do not capture the correct global\r\ngeometry and gravitational potential of galaxies. The wind mass loading factors\r\nare in fact not well-defined in local simulations because they decline\r\nsignificantly with increasing box height. More physically realistic\r\ncalculations (e.g., including a global galactic potential and disc rotation)\r\nwill likely be needed to fully understand disc turbulence and galactic\r\noutflows, even for the idealized case of feedback by SNe alone.",

In this paper, we exploit the capability of global context information by different-region-based context aggregation through our pyramid pooling module together with the proposed pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet). Our global prior representation is effective to produce good quality results on the scene parsing task, while PSPNet provides a superior framework for pixel-level prediction. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. It came first in ImageNet scene parsing challenge 2016, PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and Cityscapes benchmark. A single PSPNet yields the new record of mIoU accuracy 85.4% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and accuracy 80.2% on Cityscapes.",

Flash floods attributed to storm runoff extremes are projected to become more frequent and damaging globally due to a warming climate and anthropogenic changes, but previous studies have not examined the response of these storm runoff extremes to naturally and anthropogenically driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content. Here we show that storm runoff extremes increase in most regions at rates higher than suggested by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling, which are systematically close to or exceed those of precipitation extremes over most regions of the globe, accompanied by large spatial and decadal variability. These results suggest that current projected response of storm runoff extremes to climate and anthropogenic changes may be underestimated, posing large threats for ecosystem and community resilience under future warming conditions.",

         "abstract": "Climate simulations are one of the most data intensive scientific disciplines. We have performed another DYAMOND++ experiment using our globally coupled Earth system model ICON-ESM, which allows global simulations at a resolution of 5km to study a wide range of Earth's weather and climate phenomena. The handling of the data and the visualization is not trivial, as in this visualization we look at the full time varying 3D ocean and 3D atmospheric data. The simulation was running for one model year, from which we chose the months May, June and July for visualization. Opposed to the majority of other global climate visualizations, we chose the Spilhaus projection to put the oceans into the center and visualize them as one body of water, without cut outs, clipping planes and only minor distortions. We thereby focus on 3D atmospheric and 3D ocean data, and the interaction in between.",

Our purpose in this article is to illustrate\n\tconcretely the efficiency of this approach in the field of neuroscience\n\tand, more precisely here, in epileptology. A number of recent observations\n\thave indicated that epileptic seizures do not arise suddenly simply\n\tas the effect of random fluctuations of brain activity, but require\n\ta process of pre-seizure changes that start long before. This has\n\tbeen reported at two different levels of description: on the one\n\thand, the epileptic patient often experiences some warning symptoms\n\tthat precede seizures from several minutes to hours in the form of\n\tvery specific lived events. On the other hand, the analyses of brain\n\telectrical activities have provided strong evidence that it is possible\n\tto detect a pre-seizure state in the neuronal dynamics several minutes\n\tbefore the electro-clinical onset of a seizure. We review here some\n\tof the ongoing work of our research group concerning seizure anticipation.\n\tIn particular, we discuss experimental evidence of upward (local-to-global)\n\tformation of conscious experience and its neural substrate, but also\n\tof the downward (global-to-local) determination of local neuronal\n\tactivity by situated conscious activity and its substrate large-scale\n\tneural assemblies. This causal role of conscious experience may lead\n\tto new kinds of therapy for epileptic patients.",

It is therefore of interest to look for generic\n                 ways, compatible with natural conditions, in which\n                 evolution in simulations can be speeded. Here, we study\n                 the impact of temporally varying goals on the speed of\n                 evolution, defined as the number of generations needed\n                 for an initially random population to achieve a given\n                 goal. Using computer simulations, we find that\n                 evolution toward goals that change over time can, in\n                 certain cases, dramatically speed up evolution compared\n                 with evolution toward a fixed goal. The highest speedup\n                 is found under modularly varying goals, in which goals\n                 change over time such that each new goal shares some of\n                 the subproblems with the previous goal. The speedup\n                 increases with the complexity of the goal: the harder\n                 the problem, the larger the speedup. Modularly varying\n                 goals seem to push populations away from local fitness\n                 maxima, and guide them toward evolvable and modular\n                 solutions. This study suggests that varying\n                 environments might significantly contribute to the\n                 speed of natural evolution. In addition, it suggests a\n                 way to accelerate optimisation algorithms and improve\n                 evolutionary approaches in engineering.",

The use of weather forecasts in place of local observations can extend early warnings by up to 1\u20132 weeks, allowing for greater proactive coordination of resource-sharing and mobilization within and across countries. Using 1 year of pre-operational service in 2017 and the Fire Weather Index (FWI), here we assess the capability of the system globally and analyse in detail three major events in Chile, Portugal and California. The analysis shows that the skill provided by the ensemble forecast system extends to more than 10\u2009d when compared to the use of mean climate, making a case for extending the forecast range to the sub-seasonal to seasonal timescale. However, accurate FWI prediction does not translate into accuracy in the forecast of fire activity globally. Indeed, when all fires detected in 2017 are considered, including agricultural- and human-induced burning, high FWI values only occur in 50\u2009% of the cases and are limited to the Boreal regions. Nevertheless for very large events which were driven by weather conditions, FWI forecasts provide advance warning that could be instrumental in setting up management and containment strategies.",

We used both niche-based models (NBM) to evaluate the sensitivity of 159 endemic species to climate change (of an original 1020 plant species modeled) and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning. Endemic species modeled by NBM are moderately sensitive to projected climate change. Fewer than 5% are predicted to experience complete range loss by 2080, although more than 47% of the species are expected to be vulnerable (range reduction &gt;30%) by 2080 if they are assumed unable to migrate. Disaggregation of results by life-form showed distinct patterns. Endemic species of perennial herb, geophyte and tree life-formsare predicted to be negatively impacted in Namibia, whereas annual herb and succulent endemic species remain relatively stable by 2050 and 2080. Endemic annual herb species are even predicted to extend their range north-eastward into the tree and shrub savanna with migration, and tolerance of novel substrates. The current protected area network is predicted to meet its mandate by protecting most of the current endemicity in Namibia into the future. Vegetation simulated by DGVM is projected to experience a reduction in cover, net primary productivity and leaf area index throughout much of the country by 2050, with important implications for the faunal component of Namibia's ecosystems, and the agricultural sector. The plant functional type (PFT) composition of the major biomes may be substantially affected by climate change and rising atmospheric CO22013 currently widespread deciduous broad leaved trees and C4 PFTs decline, with the C4 PFT particularly negatively affected by rising atmospheric CO2 impacts by 223C2080 and deciduous broad leaved trees more likely directly impacted by drying and warming. The C3 PFT may increase in prominence in the northwestern quadrant of the country by 223C2080 as CO2 concentrations increase. These results suggest that substantial changes in species diversity, vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning can be expected in Namibia with anticipated climate change, although endemic plant richness may persist in the topographically diverse central escarpment region.",

The median flux ratio of O III5007 to Hbeta is 5.1+/-0.5, a factor of\r\n5-10x higher than in local galaxies with similar stellar masses. The observed\r\nHbeta luminosities are in good agreement with expectations from the estimated\r\nstar-formation rates, and none of our sources are detected in deep X-ray\r\nstacks, ruling out significant contamination by active galactic nuclei.\r\nCombining our sample with a variety of LBGs from the literature, including 49\r\ngalaxies selected in a very similar manner, we find a high median ratio of\r\nOIII/Hbeta = 4.8+0.8-1.7. This high ratio seems to be an ubiquitous feature\r\nof z~3-4 LBGs, very different from typical local star-forming galaxies at\r\nsimilar stellar masses. The only comparable systems at z~0 are those with\r\nsimilarly high specific star-formation rates, though ~5x lower stellar masses.\r\nHigh specific star-formation rates either result in a much higher ionization\r\nparameter or other unusual conditions for the interstellar medium, which result\r\nin a much higher OIII/Hbeta line ratio. This implies a strong relation\r\nbetween a global property of a galaxy, the specific star-formation rate, and\r\nthe local conditions of ISM in star-forming regions.",

First, a biomechanical model of the upper body has been developed by using inertial sensors placed at different locations on the upper body. Based on this model, a computerized RULA ergonomic assessment was implemented to permit a global risk assessment of musculoskeletal disorders in real-time. Furthermore, local scores were calculated per segment, e.g. the neck region, and gave information on the local risks for musculoskeletal disorders. Visual information was fed back to the user by using a see-through head mounted display. Additional visual highlighting and auditory warnings were provided when some predefined thresholds were exceeded. In a user study (N = 12 participants) a group with the RULA feedback was compared to a control group. Results demonstrate that the real-time ergonomic feedback significantly decreased the outcome of both globally as well as locally hazardous RULA values that are associated with increased risk for musculoskeletal disorders. Task execution time did not differ between groups. The real-time ergonomic tool introduced in this study has the potential to considerably reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in industrial settings. Implications for ergonomics in manufacturing and user feedback modalities are further discussed.",

On average\r\nin the UK, 23% of travel time is lost in connections for trips with more than\r\none mode, and the lack of synchronization decreases very slowly with population\r\nsize. This lack of synchronization between modes induces differences between\r\nthe theoretical quickest trip and the `time-respecting' path, which takes into\r\naccount waiting times at interconnection nodes. We analyse here the statistics\r\nof these paths on the multilayer, temporal network of the entire, multimodal\r\nbritish public transportation system. We propose a statistical decomposition --\r\nthe `anatomy' -- of trips in urban areas, in terms of riding, waiting and\r\nwalking times, and which shows how the temporal structure of trips varies with\r\ndistance and allows us to compare different cities. Weaknesses in systems can\r\nbe either insufficient transportation speed or service frequency, but the key\r\nparameter controlling their global efficiency is the total number of stop\r\nevents per hour for all modes. This analysis suggests the need for better\r\noptimization strategies, adapted to short, long unimodal or multimodal trips.",

A two-layer hierarchical architecture is proposed to coordinate the operations of a twin-engine propulsion system. The two engines are individually controlled to achieve enhanced performance and reliability, as necessary for fulfilling the mission objectives. Each engine, together with its continuously varying control system, is operated at the lower level under the supervision of a local discrete-event controller for condition monitoring and life extension; the gain-scheduled feedback controller that is used to maintain the specified performance of the turbofan engine is kept unaltered. A global DES controller at the upper level coordinates the local DES controllers for load balancing and health management of the propulsion system.",

         "volume": "20","number": "8","pages": "1445--1467","abstract": "Abstract The role of direct radiative forcing of desert dust aerosol in the change from wet to dry climate observed in the African Sahel region in the last half of the twentieth century is investigated using simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model. The model simulations are conducted either forced by the observed sea surface temperature (SST) or coupled with the interactive SST using the Slab Ocean Model (SOM). The simulation model uses dust that is less absorbing in the solar wavelengths and has larger particle sizes than other simulation studies. As a result, simulations show less shortwave absorption within the atmosphere and larger longwave radiative forcing by dust. Simulations using SOM show reduced precipitation over the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) including the Sahel region and increased precipitation south of the ITCZ when dust radiative forcing is included. In SST-forced simulations, on the other hand, significant precipitation changes are restricted to over North Africa. These changes are considered to be due to the cooling of global tropical oceans as well as the cooling of the troposphere over North Africa in response to dust radiative forcing. The model simulation of dust cannot capture the magnitude of the observed increase of desert dust when allowing dust to respond to changes in simulated climate, even including changes in vegetation, similar to previous studies. If the model is forced to capture observed changes in desert dust, the direct radiative forcing by the increase of North African dust can explain up to 30\\% of the observed precipitation reduction in the Sahel between wet and dry periods. A large part of this effect comes through atmospheric forcing of dust, and dust forcing on the Atlantic Ocean SST appears to have a smaller impact. The changes in the North and South Atlantic SSTs may account for up to 50\\% of the Sahel precipitation reduction. Vegetation loss in the Sahel region may explain about 10\\% of the observed drying, but this effect is statistically insignificant because of the small number of years in the simulation. Greenhouse gas warming seems to have an impact to increase Sahel precipitation that is opposite to the observed change. Although the estimated values of impacts are likely to be model dependent, analyses suggest the importance of direct radiative forcing of dust and feedbacks in modulating Sahel precipitation.",

The APEX spectra are available via the dedicated Phase 3 query  interface at the ESO Science Archive Facility:  http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_spectral/form?collection_name=ALLSMOG","abstract": "We present the final data release of the APEX low-redshift legacy survey for\r\nmolecular gas (ALLSMOG), comprising CO(2-1) emission line observations of 88\r\nnearby, low-mass (10^8.5<M* M_Sun<10^10) star-forming galaxies carried out\r\nwith the 230 GHz APEX-1 receiver on the APEX telescope. The main goal of\r\nALLSMOG is to probe the molecular gas content of more typical and lower stellar\r\nmass galaxies than have been studied by previous CO surveys. We also present\r\nIRAM 30m observations of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission lines in nine\r\ngalaxies aimed at increasing the M*<10^9 M_Sun sample size. In this paper we\r\ndescribe the observations, data reduction and analysis methods and we present\r\nthe final CO spectra together with archival HI 21cm line observations for the\r\nentire sample of 97 galaxies. At the sensitivity limit of ALLSMOG, we register\r\na total CO detection rate of 47%. Galaxies with higher M*, SFR, nebular\r\nextinction (A_V), gas-phase metallicity (O/H), and HI gas mass have\r\nsystematically higher CO detection rates. In particular, the parameter\r\naccording to which CO detections and non-detections show the strongest\r\nstatistical differences is the gas-phase metallicity, for any of the five\r\nmetallicity calibrations examined in this work. We investigate scaling\r\nrelations between the CO(1-0) line luminosity and galaxy-averaged properties\r\nusing ALLSMOG and a sub-sample of COLD GASS for a total of 185 sources that\r\nprobe the local main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and its +-0.3 dex\r\nintrinsic scatter from M* = 10^8.5 M_Sun to M* = 10^11 M_Sun. L'_CO(1-0) is\r\nmost strongly correlated with the SFR, but the correlation with M* is closer to\r\nlinear and almost comparably tight. The relation between L'_CO(1-0) and\r\nmetallicity is the steepest one, although deeper CO observations of galaxies\r\nwith A_V<0.5 mag may reveal an as much steep correlation with A_V. abridged",

The study is based on 222,060 papers (articles and reviews only) published between 1980 and 2014. The total number of papers shows a strong increase with a doubling every 5\u20136 years. Continental biomass related research is the major subfield, closely followed by climate modeling. Research dealing with adaptation, mitigation, risks, and vulnerability of global warming is comparatively small, but their share of papers increased exponentially since 2005. Research on vulnerability and on adaptation published the largest proportion of very important papers (in terms of citation impact). Climate change research has become an issue also for disciplines beyond the natural sciences. The categories Engineering and Social Sciences show the strongest field-specific relative increase. The Journal of Geophysical Research, the Journal of Climate, the Geophysical Research Letters, and Climatic Change appear at the top positions in terms of the total number of papers published. Research on climate change is quantitatively dominated by the USA, followed by the UK, Germany, and Canada. The citation-based indicators exhibit consistently that the UK has produced the largest proportion of high impact papers compared to the other countries (having published more than 10,000 papers). Also, Switzerland, Denmark and also The Netherlands (with a publication output between around 3,000 and 6,000 papers) perform top\u2014the impact of their contributions is on a high level. The title word analysis shows that the term climate change comes forward with time. Furthermore, the term impact arises and points to research dealing with the various effects of climate change. The discussion of the question of human induced climate change towards a clear fact (for the majority of the scientific community) stimulated research on future pathways for adaptation and mitigation. Finally, the term model and related terms prominently appear independent of time, indicating the high relevance of climate modeling.",

         "volume": "15","number": "1","pages": "5--56","abstract": "The profound changes now underway in Europe have been widely viewed as harbingers of a new age of peace. With the Cold War over, it is said, the threat of war that has hung over Europe for more than four decades is lifting. Swords can now be beaten into ploughshares; harmony can reign among the states and peoples of Europe. Central Europe, which long groaned under the massive forces of the two military blocs, can convert its military bases into industrial parks, playgrounds, and condominiums. Scholars of security affairs can stop their dreary quarrels over military doctrine and balance assessments, and turn their attention to finding ways to prevent global warming and preserve the ozone layer. European leaders can contemplate how to spend peace dividends. So goes the common view. This article assesses this optimistic view by exploring in detail the consequences for Europe of an end to the Cold War. Specifically, I examine the effects of a scenario under which the Cold War comes to a complete end. The Soviet Union withdraws all of its forces from Eastern Europe, leaving the states in that region fully independent. I argue that the prospects for major crises and war in Europe are likely to increase markedly if the Cold War ends and this scenario unfolds. The next decades in a Europe without the superpowers would probably not be as violent as the first 45 years of this century, but would probably be substan- tially more prone to violence than the past 45 years. This pessimistic conclusion rests on the argument that the distribution and character of military power are the root causes of war and peace. Specifically, the absence of war in Europe since 1945 has been a consequence of three factors: the bipolar distribution of military power on the Continent; the rough military equality between the two states comprising the two poles in Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union; and the fact that each superpower was armed with a large nuclear arsenal. Domestic factors also affect the likelihood of war, and have helped cause the postwar peace. Most impor- tantly, hyper-nationalism helped cause the two world wars, and the decline of nationalism in Europe since 1945 has contributed to the peacefulness of the postwar world. However, factors of military power have been most important in shaping past events, and will remain central in the future.",

A geographic search request basically contains a query consisting of one or more keywords, and a location specifying the geographic search area. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering co-located queries which are frequently searched over nearby locations. One example co-located query pattern is \"shopping mall\", \"parking\". This pattern indicates that people often search \"shopping mall\" and \"parking\" over locations close to one another. We formally define co-located query patterns and propose two approaches to mine the patterns. The basic approach is based on an existing spatial mining algorithm. To find more co-located queries that only appear in specific regions, we propose a lattice based approach. It divides the geographic space into regions and mines patterns in each region. We also define a locality measure to categorize patterns into local and global. Experimental results show that the lattice based approach achieves higher performance than the basic approach in the number of patterns, the quality of patterns, and the proportion of local patterns.",

Published in MNRAS.  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnras/stw1984","abstract": "We present the stellar surface mass density vs. gas metallicity\r\n($\\Sigma_*-Z$) relation for more than 500,000 spatially-resolved star-forming\r\nresolution elements (spaxels) from a sample of 653 disk galaxies included in\r\nthe SDSS IV MaNGA survey. We find a tight relation between these local\r\nproperties, with higher metallicities as the surface density increases. This\r\nrelation extends over three orders of magnitude in the surface mass density and\r\na factor of four in metallicity. We show that this local relationship can\r\nsimultaneously reproduce two well-known properties of disk galaxies: their\r\nglobal mass-metallicity relationship and their radial metallicity\r\ngradients. We also find that the $\\Sigma_* - Z$ relation is largely independent\r\nof the galaxy's total stellar mass and specific star-formation rate (sSFR),\r\nexcept at low stellar mass and high sSFR. These results suggest that in the\r\npresent-day universe local properties play a key role in determining the\r\ngas-phase metallicity in typical disk galaxies.",

Our star formation model\r\nis based on the local density of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) forming on dust\r\ngrains, as this may be an important ingredient for regulating star formation in\r\nthe high redshift, metal-poor regime of galaxy formation. Our stellar feedback\r\nmodel accounts for energy and momentum from supernovae, stellar winds and\r\nradiation pressure. We use a suite of simulations with different parameters and\r\nassumptions about star formation and prescription recipes. We find that in\r\norder to reproduce global properties of the Milky Way progenitors, such as star\r\nformation history and stellar mass-halo mass relation, simulations should\r\ninclude 1) a combination of local early ($t4$ Myr) momentum feedback\r\nvia radiation pressure and stellar winds and subsequent efficient supernovae\r\nfeedback, and 2) the global star formation efficiency on kiloparsec scales\r\nshould be feedback regulated. In particular, we find that in models with\r\nefficient feedback, the local efficiency of star formation per free fall time\r\ncan be substantially larger than the global star formation efficiency inferred\r\nfrom the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We find that simulations that adopt\r\ninefficient star formation inferred from such relation fail to produce vigorous\r\noutflows and eject sufficient amounts of enriched gas in order to regulate the\r\ngalactic baryon content. This illustrates the importance of understanding the\r\ncomplex interplay between star formation and feedback and the detailed\r\nprocesses that contribute to the feedback-regulated formation of galaxies.\r\n(Abridged for arXiv)",

The use of plastic and metal containers has became very popular for carrying any liquid or semi liquid content. But if we see as per the rule of nature every action has a reaction likewise after looking at the advantages there are many disadvantages for example the plastic material used for making is not decomposible naturally and has to be taken care of artificially. So the researchers today are finding the way out for processing, recycling or reusing such material for some other purpose. In today scenario the constructions globally are increasing rapidly so there is a need of the construction industry to find out the cost effective materials for increasing the strength of concrete structures. Keeping this in mind the researcher has decided to study the influence of addition of waste materials like lathe waste, soft drink bottle caps, empty waste tin, waste steel powder as a mixing material with the concrete in the percentage of maximum 1 to 1.2 of total weight of concrete. All the scrap material mentioned above was collected and processed in to strips of approximately size of 15 to 25 mm. Today due to Global warming there is a need of using maximum quantity of such recyled material by which we can conserve the natural resources and reduce the amount of materials going to our landfills. Large quantities of metal waste are generated from empty metal cans and bottle caps of juices and soft drinks. This is an environmental issue as metal waste is difficult to biodegrade and involves processes either to recycle or reuse. Today the construction industry is in need of finding effective materials for increasing the strength of concrete structures with low cost, and with less environmental damage. In this study the researcher has tried his level best for the positive results by using the waste or scraped metal material as a partial substitute for coarse aggregate with the help of orange leaves powder as a plasticizer. The parameters like slump, demoulded density, split tensile strength, compressive strength, flexural strength properties at different percentages replacement of coarse aggregate with waste bottle caps were investigated in the laboratory. In this investigation, after conducting certain laboratory tests the researcher has done the comparison between plain cement concrete and the metal fiber reinforced cement concrete in various proportions by weight. The metal fibers used in this study were irregular in shape and varying aspect ratio. Analytical comparison of both the samples was done for the parameters like compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength. After the completion of 28 days the strength of metal fiber reinforced material concrete was found increased when compared with the strength of plain cement concrete. This study was conducted with M30 cement. Mohit Sihag | V. S.

It provides a disturbance pressure boundary condition which is compatible with the recovery of perturbation velocity components that satisfy exactly the linearized continuity equation. The LPPE is employed to analyze instability in wall-bounded flows and in the prototype open Blasius boundary layer flow. In the closed flows, excellent agreement is shown between results of the LPPE and those of global linear instability analyses based on the time-stepping nektar++, Semtex and nek5000 codes, as well as with those obtained from the FreeFEM++ matrix-forming code. In the flat plate boundary layer, solutions extracted from the two-dimensional LPPE eigenvector at constant streamwise locations are found to be in very good agreement with profiles delivered by the NOLOT/PSE space marching code. Benchmark eigenvalue data are provided in all flows analyzed. The performance of the LPPE is seen to be superior to that of the commonly used pressure compatibility (PC) boundary condition: at any given resolution, the discrete part of the LPPE eigenspectrum contains converged and not converged, but physically correct, eigenvalues. By contrast, the PC boundary closure delivers some of the LPPE eigenvalues and, in addition, physically wrong eigenmodes. It is concluded that the LPPE should be used in place of the PC pressure boundary closure, when BiGlobal or TriGlobal eigenvalue problems are solved in primitive variables by the matrix-forming approach on collocated grids.",

A slab being the essential part of the building and should be successfully intended and utilized. The slab requires more concrete, while constructing the co2 emission is high and it leads to global warming, hence has to be optimized. Concrete plays a major role in the construction field. The usage of concrete is high in slab construction. Multiple elements transferring and resisting external loads throughout the structure. The vertical loads acting on the slab can be transferring to the beam and then column .The gravity path is depends upon the type of slab is used and also we consider the load transfers from the structure only on the column portion not throughout the slab. While reducing the dead weight of the slab the entire construction weight is least and cost saving is also elevated. Therefore we reduce the concrete in centre of the slab by using cast-off balls. Bubble Deck slab is one of the recently developed prefabrication construction technology functional in many engineering projects in the world. In Bubble Deck slab either can use steel balls or hollow balls will be recycled plastic and therefore it reduce the dead weight of the slab and also eliminating the concrete part which does not contribute to the structural concert. The model is analyzed by ANSYS software with appropriate support conditions as with the experimental setup and providing uniformly distributed loading in the bubble deck slab and in conventional slab. The stress and deformation results were evaluated and compared the bubble deck slab with conventional slab were observed using finite element analysis. At last the comparison has been made for Bubble Deck Slab with the Conventional slab over its self weight. From the evaluation of these results, Bubble Deck Slab gives better performance than that of the conventional slab. M. Ranjitham | N. V.

         "volume": "482","abstract": "Natural disturbances are major drivers of forest dynamics. However, in the current context of anthropogenic global warming, shifts in disturbance regimes are expected. Natural disturbances usually leave biological or structural legacies which are important for early-successional species. Nevertheless, these legacies are usually eliminated by forest managers through salvage logging. Here, we investigated the consequences of forest dieback and the following salvage logging on both forest habitat conditions and saproxylic beetle communities. We conducted our study in two types of conifer-dominated highland forests: Pyrenean silver fir (Abies alba) which has suffered drought-induced dieback and Bavarian Norway spruce (Picea abies) which has suffered bark beetle-induced (Ips typographus) dieback. In both of the forest contexts, dieback provided a biological legacy through an increase in deadwood resources; however, this increase was much greater in the spruce forests. Nonetheless, despite this increase in resources, neither type of forest gained in total abundance or species richness after disturbance, compared to healthy stands. Nevertheless, the species composition of saproxylic beetle composition was significantly affected by dieback in spruce stands, but not in the silver fir forests. In the spruce plots, saproxylic beetles responded positively to the large increase in deadwood in the declining stands, including a very strong positive response from red-listed species. Saproxylic beetle assemblages in spruce forests were mainly drove by canopy openness and deadwood amount. In the silver fir plots, we did not observed responses from the saproxylic beetle communities to deadwood amount increase. This lack of response may be explained by the relatively low amount of deadwood generated by the drought-induced dieback. Concerning salvage logging, it caused stronger contrasts in spruce forests than in silver fir forests, where it generally had no significant impact. For example, in spruce forests, salvage logging reduced the density of large snags by 91% and large logs by 87% compared with unharvested declining plots. Most of the significant environmental effects on biodiversity associated with dieback were no longer significant after accounting for the salvaged plots in our study data. Then, forest dieback and salvage logging induced much sharper and stronger effects on environmental and community metrics in the spruce than in the silver fir forests. The contrast between Bavaria and the French Pyrenees seems partly related to dieback severity. Finally, we invite forest managers to conserve biological and structural legacies through patches of deadwood-rich areas.",

Such models require meteorological forcing data, and this paper describes the creation of the WATCH Forcing Data for 1958?2001 based on the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and for 1901?57 based on reordered reanalysis data. It also discusses and analyses model-independent estimates of reference crop evaporation. Global average annual cumulative reference crop evaporation was selected as a widely adopted measure of potential evapotranspiration. It exhibits no significant trend from 1979 to 2001 although there are significant long-term increases in global average vapor pressure deficit and concurrent significant decreases in global average net radiation and wind speed. The near-constant global average of annual reference crop evaporation in the late twentieth century masks significant decreases in some regions (e.g., the Murray?Darling basin) with significant increases in others.",

Although considerable progress has been made in the statistical modeling during the last decade, many approaches still ignore important features of species distributions, such as nonlinearity and interactions between predictors, spatial autocorrelation, and nonstationarity, or at most incorporate only some of these features. Ecologists, however, require a modeling framework that simultaneously addresses all these features flexibly and consistently. Here we describe such an approach that allows the estimation of the global effects of environmental variables in addition to local components dealing with spatiotemporal autocorrelation as well as nonstationary effects. The local components can be used to infer unknown spatiotemporal processes; the global component describes how the species is influenced by the environment and can be used for predictions, allowing the fitting of many well-known regression relationships, ranging from simple linear models to complex decision trees or from additive models to models inspired by machine learning procedures. The reliability of spatiotemporal predictions can be qualitatively predicted by separately evaluating the importance of local and global effects. We demonstrate the potential of the new approach by modeling the breeding distribution of the Red Kite (Milvus milvus), a bird of prey occurring predominantly in Western Europe, based on presence/absence data from two mapping campaigns using grids of 40 km2 in Bavaria. The global component of the model selected seven environmental variables extracted from the CORINE and WorldClim databases to predict Red Kite breeding. The effect of altitude was found to be nonstationary in space, and in addition, the data were spatially autocorrelated, which suggests that a species distribution model that does not allow for spatially varying effects and spatial autocorrelation would have ignored important processes determining the distribution of Red Kite breeding across Bavaria. Thus, predictions from standard species distribution models that do not allow for real-world complexities may be considerably erroneous. Our analysis of Red Kite breeding exemplifies the potential of the innovative approach for species distribution models. The method is also applicable to modeling count data.\nKey words:\u2003 boosting, model selection, nonstationarity, spatial autocorrelation, species distribution model, structured additive model, variable selection",

As an extension to medical imaging, the present work incorporates priors on network hierarchies of brain regions into logistic-regression to distinguish neural activity effects. These priors bridge two separately studied levels of brain architecture: functional segregation into regions and functional integration by networks. Hierarchical region-network priors are shown to better classify and recover 18 psychological tasks than other sparse estimators. Varying the relative importance of region and network structure within the hierarchical tree penalty captured complementary aspects of the neural activity patterns. Local and global priors of neurobiological knowledge are thus demonstrated to offer advantages in generalization performance, sample complexity, and domain interpretability.",

For a wide range of driving rates R the traffic is stationary and the load time series exhibits antipersistence due to the regulatory role of the superstructure associated with two hub nodes in the network. We discuss how the superstructure affects the functioning of the network at high traffic density and at the jamming threshold. The degree of correlations systematically decreases with increasing traffic density and eventually disappears when approaching a jamming density Rc. Already before jamming we observe qualitative changes in the global network-load distributions and the particle queuing times. These changes are related to the occurrence of temporary crises in which the network-load increases dramatically, and then slowly falls back to a value characterizing free flow.",

We aim at simulating realistic short polymers from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. An interesting issue is then to know the influence of the adjustable parameters of the DPD: γ, the friction coefficient, and rC, the cut-off radius, on the global and local dynamics of the polymer, i.e., the diffusion coefficient, DCM, the end-to-end decorrelation time, τR and the Rouse times. By varying these two parameters, we investigate structural and dynamical properties for different polymeric systems at a given chain length. Although scaling laws typical of the Rouse model have been reproduced using this DPD method, we observe deviation from the Rouse theory for the local dynamics of certain systems. The dynamical properties of the polymer melt are defined simultaneously by γ and rC. Therefore we combine these two parameters, introducing a new parameter, the effective friction coefficient, γeff.",

While changes in atmospheric composition are expected to exert an increasing radiative forcing of climate change leading to further warming of global mean temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, these are not the only climatic processes which may influence crop production. Changes in the physical characteristics of the land cover may also affect climate; these may arise directly from land use activities and may also result from the large-scale responses of crops to seasonal, interannual and decadal changes in the atmospheric state. Climate models used to drive crop models may, therefore, need to consider changes in the land surface, either as imposed boundary conditions or as feedbacks from an interactive climate-vegetation model. Crops may also respond directly to changes in atmospheric composition, such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (03) and compounds of sulphur and nitrogen, so crop models should consider these processes as well as climate change. Changes in these, and the responses of the crops, may be intimately linked with meteorological processes so crop and climate models should consider synergies between climate and atmospheric chemistry. Some crop responses may occur at scales too small to significantly influence meteorology, so may not need to be included as feedbacks within climate models. However, the volume of data required to drive the appropriate crop models may be very large, especially if short-time-scale variability is important. Implementation of crop models within climate models would minimize the need to transfer large quantities of data between separate modelling systems. It should also be noted that crop responses to climate change may interact with other impacts of climate change, such as hydrological changes. For example, the availability of water for irrigation may be affected by changes in runoff as a direct consequence of climate change, and may also be affected by climate-related changes in demand for water for other uses. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the interactions between the responses of several impacts sectors to climate change. Overall, there is a strong case for a much closer coupling between models of climate, crops and hydrology, but this in itself poses challenges arising from issues of scale and errors in the models. A strategy is proposed whereby the pursuit of a fully coupled climate-chemistry-crop-hydrology model is paralleled by continued use of separate climate and land surface models but with a focus on consistency between the models.",

We have also discussed the\r\nphysical implementation of our model taking the examples of\r\na smart home sample application and the performance results\r\nhave been tabulated and represented graphically.",

         "abstract": "From Publishers Weekly\n'Unilateralism, arrogance, and parochialism' the U.S. must abandon these traits in a post-Sept. 11 world, says Nye, former assistant secretary of defense and now dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He explains eloquently the principles he believes should govern American foreign policy in the decades ahead. His starting point is the preponderance of American power in today's world. Nye distinguishes between hard power (military and economic strength) and soft power (openness, prosperity and similar values that persuade and attract rather than coerce others). Nye argues that a dominant state needs both kinds of power, and that the current information revolution and the related phenomenon of globalization call for the exercise of soft more than hard power. It is, Nye believes, dangerous for the U.S. systematically to opt out of treaties and conventions endorsed by the great majority of nations. The U.S. should participate in world debate on transnational issues such as global warming and nuclear defense, not simply declare American interests paramount to the exclusion of all other views. Nye quotes a summarizing insight from a French critic: 'nothing in the world can be done without the United States, And. there is very little the United States can achieve alone.' As the author points out, in the aftermath of September 11, the policy issues this book addresses are magnified rather than diminished in importance. This reasoned and timely essay on the uses of power makes a valuable contribution to American public discourse. (Mar.)Forecast: Blurbs by Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger highlight that this should be required reading for foreign policy wonks. Oxford is backing this with a \\$50,000 marketing budget and is counting on major media attention. Still, whether this finds a wider audience may depend on whether Americans' interest in the world at large survives six months after September 11.\nCopyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\n\n\n\nFrom Booklist\nNye, former assistant secretary of defense under Clinton and current dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, offers a prescription for America's new role in the world that calls for a broader, more responsible, and cooperative relationship with the rest of the world. Nye sees September 11 as a 'wake-up call' to Americans that negates our decade-long sense of invincibility and invulnerability in the wake of the invisible power now held by NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) and stealthy terrorist organizations. The main instigator of this dissipation of traditional American power is the technological revolution, which has been diffusing power away from governments during the post-Soviet decade and thus empowering individuals and groups to act globally in ways that were previously the domain of governments. Nye calls upon the U.S. to counter these forces by the use of 'soft power,' by which he means, for instance, a more focused and intelligent use of new forms of mass communications. A very thoughtful look ahead at American power through this century. Allen Weakland\nCopyright \\copyright American Library Association. All rights reserved",

This technique is used to reduce number of computations of video compression by maintaining same or better quality of video. In the proposed technique, the position equation of Standard Particle Swarm Optimization is modified and used as step size equation to find best matching block in current frame. To achieve adaptive step size, time varying inertia weight is used instead of constant inertia weight for getting true motion vector dynamically. The time varying inertia weight is based up on previous motion vectors. The step size equation is used to predict best matching macro block in the reference frame with respect to macro block in the current frame for which motion vector is found. The result of proposed technique is compared with existing block matching algorithms. The performance of Memetic Algorithm is good as compared to existing algorithms in terms number of computations and accuracy.",

Based on an existing optimization approach for solving the maximum value release planning problem for a fixed release time, we provide a re-optimization approach for which includes local and global re-planning exchange operations to determine the outcome of varying the release dates. The proposed method determines a set of trade-off solutions related to (i) the value of the features implemented, (ii) their estimated quality, and (iii) the release time. The approach is evaluated by a real-world case study taken from an ongoing project which is to develop the new main release 2.0 for the release planning decision support platform ReleasePlanner&#x2122; v1.6.",

It is one of the identified plants from among the seventeen plants families that are cited in the Holy Quran. The plant is used as a source of food, fodder, lipids, gum and resins. In addition, it is also valued for rearing honey bees. Its roots are regularly used as tooth brush throughout the country. Besides these the plant is also grown to provide shelter belts and windbreakes for agriculture crops. It is distributed throughout the arid and semi arid ecosystem of world and helps in reclamation of sand dune habitats and saline soils in arid ecosystems. However, its population suffers from serious environmental problems such as deforestation, soil degradation, loss of biodiversity and unsustainable livelihoods. S. persica has high medicinal, economic and ecological values in arid and semiarid ecosystem. Nevertheless, its conservation status is highly threatened and detailed ecological study of S. persica is suggested to conserve its remaining population. Miswak Salvadora Persica is an important shrub small tree of the Indian sub continent. Due to its multipurpose use it has been exploited ruthlessly by all the sections of the society since decades which has endangered its status. Because of its great medicinal properties it has been in heavy demand in the Indian Herbal Drug Industry. Its branches are commonly used as tooth brush in villages and rural area of the country. Apart from its medicinal benefits it can also be utilized for carbon storage and sequestration for long durations thus, helps in our fight against Global Warming and Climate Change. As the shrub tree has become endangered all steps need to be taken to conserve this important species otherwise a time would come when we would be devoid of its multiple benefits. Plant Tissue Culture is an excellent technique for large scale propagation of this tree species and at present there are various protocols available in public domain for its mass multiplication but none of the protocols has been utilized to restore the plant status till date. Serious efforts by Government Central and State are required for mass multiplication of the species on one hand and conservation of its germplasm on the other.

The stellar mass growth history of Milky Way-mass\r\nprogenitor SFGs is inferred from the evolution of the star formation rate\r\n(SFR)$-$stellar mass ($M_\\ast$) relation, and the gas mass ($M_gas$) is\r\nderived using the recently established gas scaling relations. With the\r\n$M_\\ast+M_gas$ growth curve, the net inflow rate $\\kappa$ is quantified\r\nat each cosmic epoch. At $z1.3$, $\\kappa$ is comparable with the SFR,\r\nwhereas it rapidly decreases to $0.15\\times$SFR at $z=0$. We then\r\nconstrain the average outflow rate $\\zeta_outflow$ of progenitor galaxies\r\nby modeling the evolution of their gas-phase metallicity. The best-fit\r\n$\\zeta_outflow$ is found to be $(0.5-0.8)\\times$SFR. Combining $\\kappa$\r\nand $\\zeta_outflow$, we finally investigate the evolution of $\\zeta_\\rm\r\ninflow$ since $z=1.3$. We find that $\\zeta_inflow$ rapidly decreases by\r\n$\\sim$80\\% from $z=1.3$ to $z=0.5$. At $z<0.5$, $\\zeta_inflow$\r\ncontinuously decreases but with a much lower decreasing rate. Implications of\r\nthese findings on galaxy evolution are discussed.",

Our early-time afterglow detections began under 15 s after the burst\r\nin the host frame (redshift z = 1.73), and they yield constraints on the burst\r\nenergetics and local environment. Late-time afterglow observations of the burst\r\nshow evidence for a moderate column of dust (A_V ~ 1.1 mag) similar to, but\r\nstatistically distinct from, dust seen along Small Magellanic Cloud sightlines.\r\nDeep late-time observations reveal a dusty, rapidly star-forming host galaxy.\r\nMost notably, our early-time observations exhibit a significant red-to-blue\r\ncolour change in the first ~200 s after the trigger at levels heretofore unseen\r\nin GRB afterglows. This colour change, which is coincident with the final\r\nphases of the prompt emission, is a hallmark prediction of the photodestruction\r\nof dust in GRB afterglows. We test whether dust-destruction signatures are\r\nsignificantly distinct from other sources of colour change, namely a change in\r\nthe intrinsic spectral index \\beta. We find that a time-varying power-law\r\nspectrum alone cannot adequately describe the observed colour change, and\r\nallowing for dust destruction (via a time-varying A_V) significantly improves\r\nthe fit. While not definitively ruling out other possibilities, this event\r\nprovides the best support yet for the direct detection of dust destruction in\r\nthe local environment of a GRB.",

Although hi-tech vehicles and equipment have overcome older version of vehicles and equipment and also they made farming quite easy. But it still requires a plenty of human effort. Today automation has been introduced in almost every form of industry and a prominent reason to reducing human effort. Our Objective is to reduce human efforts in farming as we planned to develop an autonomous guidance system for farm vehicles. Our system will be based on Global Positioning System (GPS) 1. To develop complete autonomous system, other than GPS, systems like machine vision, laser-based sensors, inertial sensors would be needed to be employed for avoiding obstacles in the path and overcoming other challenges. However making such systems would require more time and monetary resources then available, hence developing such complete autonomous system is out of scope of the current task at hand. Our aim is to develop a Mixture of such complete autonomous system which will fulfill one of the Basic needs of a complete autonomous guidance system.",

It unfolds a comparatively small database into a complex world featuring terrain, vegetation and bodies of water. This approach allows for adaptivity of generated assets to their environment, unbounded worlds and interactivity in their generation. In order to evaluate the model, we conducted sensitivity analyses at a local interaction scale. In addition, at a global scale, we investigated two virtual environments, discussing notable interactions, recurring configuration patterns, and obstacles in working with SGs. These analyses showed that SGs can create visually interesting virtual worlds, but require further work in ease of use. Lastly we identified which future extensions might shrink required database sizes.",

Therefore, the specific aims of this article are to ascertain the influence of employee motivation on global productivity in a fair globalization, assess the impact of overlapping membership in multinational countries on multilateral trade and investment in a fair globalization, and evaluate the effects of new information and communication technologies. The main effects of unfair globalization include restrictions on the free flow of ideas and information, restrictions on capital flows, and restrictions on the export of goods. A volume of the International Labour Organization's published report collected by the world commission on the social Dimension of Globalization along with other documents, was used as a secondary source of data in the methodology. This study revealed the urgent need for a rethink of global governance structures and policies as well as the necessity to create a fair and inclusive globalization as a global priority. The International Labour Organization (ILO), an organization that upholds the fundamental human rights of the working class, supports the findings of the world commission on the social impact of globalization.",

In order to determine the minimal number of joints to be included in such a scoring system, and to analyze the metric properties of proposed global (i.e., patient level) ultrasound (US) scoring systems of synovitis in RA, a systematic analysis of the literature was performed.A systematic literature search of Pubmed and Embase was performed (January 1, 1984, to March 31, 2010). Original research reports written in English including RA, ultrasound, Doppler, and scoring systems were included. The design, subjects, methods, imaging protocols, and performance characteristics studied were analyzed, as well as the ultrasound definition of synovitis.Of 3004 reports identified, 14 articles were included in the review. We found a lack of clear definition of synovitis as well as varying validity data with respect to the proposed scores. Scoring systems included a wide range and number of joints. All analyzed studies assessed construct validity and responsiveness by using clinical examination, laboratory findings, and other imaging modalities as comparators. Both construct validity and responsiveness varied according to the number and size of joints examined and according to the component of synovitis measured i.e., gray-scale (GS) or power Doppler (PD) alone or in combination. With regard to feasibility, time of evaluation varied from 15 to 60 min and increased with the number of joints involved in the examination.Ultrasound can be regarded as a valuable tool for globally examining the extent of synovitis in RA. However, it is presently difficult to determine a minimal number of joints to be included in a global ultrasound score. Further validation of proposed scores is needed.",

         "abstract": "In this study, we assess global hydropower potential using runoff and stream flow data, along with turbine technology performance, cost assumptions, and consideration of protected areas. The results provide the first comprehensive quantification of global hydropower potential including gross, technical, economic, and exploitable estimates. Total global potential of gross, technical, economic, and exploitable hydropower are estimated to be approximately 128, 26, 21, and 16 petawatt hours per year, respectively. The economic and exploitable potential of hydropower are calculated at less than 9 cents/kWh. We find that hydropower has the potential to supply a significant portion of the world energy needs, although this potential varies substantially by region. Globally, hydropower potential is comparable to the total electricity demand in 2005. Hydropower plays different roles in each country owing to regional variation in potential relative to electricity demand. In some countries such as the Congo, there is sufficient hydropower potential (>10 times) to meet all electricity demands, while in other countries such as United Kingdom, hydropower potential can only accommodate a small portion (<3\\%) of total demand. A sensitivity analysis indicates that hydropower estimates are sensitive to a number of parameters: design flow (varying by -10\\% to +0\\% at less than 9 cents/kWh), cost assumptions (by -35\\% to +12\\%), turbine efficiency (by -40\\% to +20\\%), stream flow (by -35\\% to +35\\%), fixed charge rate (by -15\\% to 10\\%), and protected land (by -15\\% to 20\\%). This sensitivity analysis emphasizes the reliable role of hydropower for future energy systems, when compared to other renewable energy resources with larger uncertainty in their future potentials.",

Cultivation of Chinese medicinal herbs and usage of traditional Chinese medicine significantly helps to promote sustainable agricultural development via growing demand for organic and herbal products in different regions. Chinese medicinal plants, both endemic and widespread, must be preserved since these plants could be renewable source for new drugs. Some advantages of organic farming of medicinal plants are to produce material in optimal quality and sufficient quantity, to protect medicinal plants against pests and disease, to maintain the genetic diversity of medicinal plants, the enhance the biosynthesis of efficacious substances, to increase growth rate and biomass yield of medicinal plants. On the basis of economic prospects, organic farming may lead to increase more market opportunity, to maintain high market price, to achieve optimal quality and economic returns and to secure economic growth and social stability. Traditional Chinese medicine plays an important role in sustainable agriculture and food systems, it also offers a holistic approach to prevent diseases while making appropriate use of organic and herbal products especially growth by small-scale family farmers.",

Consideration is confined to the formation of local intracortical connections and to the case where the distribution of axonal and dendritic fibres has spherical symmetry. Parameters are deduced from quantitative anatomical studies in murine cortex. It is demonstrated that the majority of local connections forming within a given volume of isotropic cortex can be accounted for on the assumption that local connections between neurons form randomly.\r\nFrom these computations the symmetry of connection between neurons, the likely position for synapse formation on the dendritic tree and the relative synaptic densities attributable to long-and short-range interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neural subsets is determined. Local intracortical couplings appear to be highly asymmetric, and account for about 3200 synapses forming on pyramidal and stellate cells.",

In contrast to bottom-up methods, depth-first top-down parsing produces partial parses that are fully connected trees spanning the entire left context, from which any kind of non-local dependency or partial semantic interpretation can in principle be read. We contrast two predictive parsing approaches, top-down and left-corner parsing, and find both to be viable. In addition, we find that enhancement with non-local information not only improves parser accuracy, but also substantially improves the search efficiency.",

To\r\ntest this premise, we compare and contrast the local environment of both\r\npassive and star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass, using the\r\nGalaxy and Mass Assembly survey. We find that passive fractions are higher in\r\nboth interacting pair and group galaxies than the field at all stellar masses,\r\nand that this effect is most apparent in the lowest mass galaxies. We also find\r\nthat essentially all passive log$_10$M$_*$/M$_ødot$<8.5 galaxies are\r\nfound in pair/group environments, suggesting that local interactions with a\r\nmore massive neighbour cause them to cease forming new stars. We find that the\r\neffects of immediate environment (local galaxy-galaxy interactions) in forming\r\npassive systems increases with decreasing stellar mass, and highlight that this\r\nis potentially due to increasing interaction timescales giving sufficient time\r\nfor the galaxy to become passive via starvation. We then present a simplistic\r\nmodel to test this premise, and show that given our speculative assumptions, it\r\nis consistent with our observed results.",

We show that global depletion times are not set by any\r\n\"bottleneck\" in the process of gas evolution towards the star-forming state.\r\nInstead, depletion times are long because star-forming gas converts only a\r\nsmall fraction of its mass into stars before it is dispersed by dynamical and\r\nfeedback processes. Thus, complete depletion requires that gas transitions\r\nbetween star-forming and non-star-forming states multiple times. Our model does\r\nnot rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to interpret trends\r\nof depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies and the parameters\r\nof star formation and feedback recipes in galaxy simulations. In particular,\r\nthe model explains the mechanism by which feedback self-regulates star\r\nformation rate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star\r\nformation efficiency. We illustrate our model using the results of an isolated\r\n$L_*$-sized disk galaxy simulation that reproduces the observed\r\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation for both molecular and atomic gas. Interestingly,\r\nthe relation for molecular gas is close to linear on kiloparsec scales, even\r\nthough a non-linear relation is adopted in simulation cells. This difference is\r\ndue to stellar feedback, which breaks the self-similar scaling of the gas\r\ndensity PDF with the average gas surface density.",

The uncertainty may be due to parameter variations, aerodynamics, external disturbances, etc., which is nonlinear and time-varying. Subject to the collision avoidance consideration, the original state is one-sided restricted. To resolve this restriction, we propose a state transformation to convert the bounded state into a globally unbounded state. Furthermore, motivated by the properties of artificial swarm systems, we incorporate the swarm system performance into the platoon system by treating it as a d'Alembert's constraint. By the Udwadia and Kalaba's approach, we obtain the analytic (closed-form) expression of the constraint force. Based on this, a class of robust controls for each vehicle (except the leading vehicle) is proposed to drive the platoon system to follow the ideal swarm model. Four major system performances are accomplished: (i) compact vehicle formation, (ii) collision avoidance, (iii) stable platoon system formation, (iv) global behavior.",

         "volume": "6","number": "4","pages": "1448-1453","abstract": "Since the agrarian revolution during the 18th century, the use of technology to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of farming practices has increased tremendously. Discoveries in the field of science and technology have enabled farmers to effectively use their input to maximize their yield. These advancements have been greatly assisted by the use of sophisticated machineries, planting practices, use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides and so on. At the present moment however, the success of large scale farming highly relies on geographic information technology through what is known as precision farming. Precision agriculture, or precision farming, is therefore a farming concept that utilizes geographical information to determine field variability to ensure optimal use of inputs and maximize the output from a farm Esri, 2008 . Precision agriculture gained popularity after the realization that diverse fields of land hold different properties. Large tracts of land usually have spatial variations of soils types, moisture content, nutrient availability and so on. Therefore, with the use of remote sensing, geographical information systems GIS and global positioning systems GPS , farmers can more precisely determine what inputs to put exactly where and with what quantities. This information helps farmers to effectively use expensive resources such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, and more efficiently use water resources. In the end, farmers who use this method not only maximize on their yields but also reduce their operating expenses, thus increasing their profits. On these grounds therefore, this article shall focus on the use of geospatial technologies in precision farming. To achieve this, the paper shall focus on how geospatial data is collected, analyzed and used in the decision making process to maximize on yields.

The effects are felt not only in the centre of action, the tropical Pacific region, but around the globe. Observational studies show a clear response in European climate to ENSO in late winter1. However, the underlying mechanisms of the link are not yet understood. Here we use a general circulation model of the atmosphere, that has been extended into the upper atmospheric layers, to provide end-to-end evidence for a global teleconnection pathway from the Pacific region to Europe via the stratosphere. We present evidence for an active stratospheric role in the transition to cold conditions in northern Europe and mild conditions in southern Europe in late winter during El Niño years. In our experiments, this mechanism is restricted to years when stratospheric sudden warmings occur. The response in European surface climate to the El Niño signal is large enough to be useful for seasonal forecasting.",

Poverty is one of the major challenges for our society in the upcoming decades, making it one of the most important issues in the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations. Satellite-based mapping can provide valuable information about slums where insights about the location and size are still missing. Large-scale slum mapping remains a challenge, fuzzy feature spaces between formal and informal settlements, significant imbalance of slum occurrences opposed to formal settlements, and various categories of multiple morphological slum features. We propose a transfer learned fully convolutional Xception network (XFCN), which is able to differentiate between formal built-up structures and the various categories of slums in high-resolution satellite data. The XFCN is trained on a large sample of globally distributed slums, located in cities of Cape Town, Caracas, Delhi, Lagos, Medellin, Mumbai, Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Shenzhen. Slums in these cities are greatly heterogeneous inits morphological feature space and differ to a varying degree to formal settlements. Transfer learning can help to improve segmentation results when learning on a variety of slum morphologies, with high F1 scores of up to 89%.",

         "volume": "P-295","abstract": "Every year, about 310,500 pedestrians still lose their lives in traffic accidents worldwide. Cooperative pedestrian collision avoidance represents a promising approach to reduce those accident numbers. This approach assumes that pedestrians are equipped with mobile devices to obtain and exchange their current movement information with nearby vehicles and use those to predict and prevent possible collisions. However, the ability to predict collisions between a pedestrian and a vehicle also depends on the assumptions about the pedestrian\u2019s future behavior. One important aspect of those assumptions is a pedestrian\u2019s individual walking pattern, like his common or maximum speed. Thus, learning and applying individual walking speed profiles of pedestrians to improve movement prediction may increase the accuracy of a collision detection algorithm and could, in turn, reduce the probability of missing or erroneously triggering an alarm. In this publication, we propose an approach to learn individual walking speed profiles of a pedestrian based on smartphone Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data and evaluate the ability to predict collisions based on those profiles. Therefore, we first conducted experiments to estimate the error of walking speed obtained from smartphone GNSS. Second, using our Pedestrian Monitor application, we recorded real-world walking speed information from nine participants. Based on these data, we show that individually learned walking speed profiles are able to increase the accuracy of predicting an impending collision.",

It is software's responsibility to dynamically transfer the working set into the local memory when the total data set is too large to fit in the local memory. The data can be transferred through either a software controlled cache or a direct buffer. Such a software cache can maintain correctness and exploit reuse among references, especially when complicated aliasing or data dependences exist. However, the software cache introduces the extra overhead of cache lookup. Direct buffering, on the other hand, is fast but is limited by the compiler's ability to disambiguate memory references. It is desirable to judiciously use both methods, for irregular and regular accesses respectively. However, when a datum resides in both the software cache and the direct buffer, coherence problems occur.</p> <p>In this paper, we propose a solution which provides compile time analysis and runtime maintenance to address this coherence issue. We use compiler analysis to guarantee that there is no access to software cache within the local live range of a direct buffer, and rely on runtime support to update values from or to software cache at the entry or exit of the direct buffer. Further, we present a global data flow analysis design to eliminate redundant coherence maintenance, and overlap computation and DMA accesses to reduce runtime overhead. We have implemented this method in our Single Source Compiler for Cell, and have conducted experiments with the NAS OpenMP benchmarks. The results show that our method maintains correctness while keeping most of the opportunities for direct buffering. The execution performance can increase more than 3x compared to approaches using only the software cache. Furthermore, compile time analysis can reduce 90% of the runtime updates, thereby improving performance by 20% further.",

Earlier floral anthesis has been suggested, in turn, to have a role in human disease by increasing time of exposure to pollen that causes allergic rhinitis and related asthma. However, earlier floral initiation does not necessarily alter the temporal duration of the pollen season, and, to date, no consistent continental trend in pollen season length has been demonstrated. Here we report that duration of the ragweed (Ambrosia spp.) pollen season has been increasing in recent decades as a function of latitude in North America. Latitudinal effects on increasing season length were associated primarily with a delay in first frost of the fall season and lengthening of the frost free period. Overall, these data indicate a significant increase in the length of the ragweed pollen season by as much as 13\u201327 d at latitudes above \\~44°N since 1995. This is consistent with recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections regarding enhanced warming as a function of latitude. If similar warming trends accompany long-term climate change, greater exposure times to seasonal allergens may occur with subsequent effects on public health.",

First, an improved siphon-based liveness characterization for the Petri nets modeling C/D-RAS is proposed. Subsequently, this characterization facilitates the utilization of a mixed integer programming (MIP) based deadlock prevention policy that can well avoid the explicit enumeration of both siphons and the reachable states. The resulting policy is implemented by an iterative algorithm each step of which is characterized as an MIP formulation in conjunction with both a bad marking detection and a feedback control operation. Finally, the deadlock prevention policy developed in this paper is, respectively, characterized by the local and global ones so as to realize a trade-off between the behavior permissiveness and the structural simplicity of the supervisor. Both the theoretical and experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of such an approach.",

Seasonal anomalies are created from MODIS Terra (\\~10:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. local solar time) and Aqua (\\~1:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. local solar time) LSTs, and their spatiotemporal variability is analyzed by comparing the LST changes between wind farm pixels (WFPs) and nearby non wind farm pixels (NNWFPs) using different methods under different quality controls. Our analyses show consistently that there is a warming effect of 0.31\u20130.70 °C at nighttime for the nine-year period during which data was collected over WFPs relative to NNWFPs, in all seasons for both Terra and Aqua measurements, while the changes at daytime are much noisier. The nighttime warming effect is much larger in summer than winter and at \\~10:30 p.m. than \\~1:30 a.m. and hence the largest warming effect is observed at \\~10:30 p.m. in summer. The spatial pattern and magnitude of this warming effect couple very well with the geographic distribution of wind turbines and such coupling is stronger at nighttime than daytime and in summer than winter. Together, these results suggest that the warming effect observed in MODIS over wind farms are very likely attributable to the development of wind farms. This inference is consistent with the increasing number of operational wind turbines with time during the study period, the diurnal and seasonal variations in the frequency of wind speed and direction distribution, and the changes in near-surface atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions due to wind farm operations. The nocturnal ABL is typically stable and much thinner than the daytime ABL and hence the turbine enhanced vertical mixing produces a stronger nighttime effect. The stronger wind speed and the higher frequency of the wind speed within the optimal power generation range in summer than winter and at nighttime than daytime likely drives wind turbines to generate more electricity and turbulence and consequently results in the strongest warming effect at nighttime in summer. Similarly, the stronger wind speed and the higher frequency of optimal wind speed at \\~10:30 p.m. than that at \\~1:30 a.m. might help explain, to some extent, why the nighttime LST warming effect is slightly larger at \\~10:30 p.m. than \\~1:30 a.m. The nighttime warming effect seen in spring and fall are smaller than that in summer and can be explained similarly.",

         "note": "cite arxiv:1210.4957Comment: ApJ submitted. For a high-resolution version of the paper, see  http://kicp.uchicago.edu/~agertz/","abstract": "Stellar feedback plays a key role in galaxy formation by regulating star\r\nformation, driving interstellar turbulence and generating galactic scale\r\noutflows. Although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of\r\n10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, \"subgrid\" scales.\r\nGreat care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for the\r\neffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. We investigate the momentum and\r\nenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and\r\nstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star\r\nforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern\r\ncosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid\r\nmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds\r\nfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young\r\nstar clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star\r\nforming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density\r\nmitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernova\r\nexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. The\r\ndetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation\r\nand choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations\r\nin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of global\r\nstar formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback\r\nimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal\r\nfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formal\r\ngas cooling time. We find that simulations with maximal momentum injection\r\nsuppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adopting\r\nadiabatic thermal feedback.",

         "abstract": "The dynamics of interfaces in random media has recieved much attention in the last decade.This kind of systems exhibits a rich behaviour, which is not yet fully understood.\nIt's well known that at zero temperature these systems undergo a dynamic phase transition  that arises from competition between the driving force and the pinning due to the disorder. However, it's interesting to know how they evolve in the presence of non-negligible thermal fluctuations.\n\nThis finite-temperature problem in countinuous limit was studied numerically in 1. They observed glassy behaviour in the low temperature regime, and also long-range correlations in the global velocity for optimal temperature.This suggests existence of local temperature-induced avalanches of depinning events.\n \nHere, we further investigate the problem of interfase depinning at finite-temperature. We propose a cellular automaton model to study this problem in the discrete limit (for both QEW and QKPZ).For an optimal range of temperatures we observe critical-like behaviour, characterized by interesting spacial and time correlations. In this case we are able to visualize and study these correlations (fig.1). We find power law scaling in the distributions of waiting times, distances between active-points at the same time, and global velocity espectra.\n We also observe glassy behaviour below this critical-like regime, as in the continuous model1.\n\n1) J.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were grown in TGCs for a whole season under two levels of CO2 (ambient, 380 ppm; elevated, 622 ppm) and two daily Tair regimes (ambient, 25.2°C; elevated, 27.3°C) in split-plot design with triplication. The effects of elevated CO2 and Tair on DM were most dramatic for grain and shoot with a significant (P\u20092 and Tair. Overall, total grain DM increased with elevated CO2 by 69.6\\% in ambient Tair but decreased with elevated Tair by 33.8\\% in ambient CO2 due to warming-induced floral sterility. Meanwhile, shoot DM significantly increased with elevated Tair by 20.8\\% in ambient CO2 and by 46.6\\% in elevated CO2. Although no CO2\u2009×\u2009Tair interaction was detected, the greatest total DM was achieved by co-elevation of CO2 and Tair (by 42.8\\% relative to the ambient conditions) via enhanced shoot and root DM accumulation, but not grain. This was attributed largely both to increase in tiller number and to accumulation of photosynthate in the shoot and root due to inhibition of photosynthate allocation to grain caused by warming-induced floral sterility. Distribution of N (both soil N and fertilizer 15N) among rice parts in responding to climatic variables entirely followed the pattern of DM. Our findings demonstrate that the projected warming is likely to induce a significant reduction in grain yield of rice by inhibiting DM (i.e., photosynthates) allocation to grain, though this may partially be mitigated by elevated CO2.",

         "volume": "8","number": "4","pages": "219--236","abstract": "Despite a significant growth in food production over the past half-century, one of the most important challenges facing society today is how to feed an expected population of some nine billion by the middle of the 20th century. To meet the expected demand for food without significant increases in prices, it has been estimated that we need to produce 70?100 per cent more food, in light of the growing impacts of climate change, concerns over energy security, regional dietary shifts and the Millennium Development target of halving world poverty and hunger by 2015. The goal for the agricultural sector is no longer simply to maximize productivity, but to optimize across a far more complex landscape of production, rural development, environmental, social justice and food consumption outcomes. However, there remain significant challenges to developing national and international policies that support the wide emergence of more sustainable forms of land use and efficient agricultural production. The lack of information flow between scientists, practitioners and policy makers is known to exacerbate the difficulties, despite increased emphasis upon evidence-based policy. In this paper, we seek to improve dialogue and understanding between agricultural research and policy by identifying the 100 most important questions for global agriculture. These have been compiled using a horizon-scanning approach with leading experts and representatives of major agricultural organizations worldwide. The aim is to use sound scientific evidence to inform decision making and guide policy makers in the future direction of agricultural research priorities and policy support. If addressed, we anticipate that these questions will have a significant impact on global agricultural practices worldwide, while improving the synergy between agricultural policy, practice and research. This research forms part of the UK Government's Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures project.",

         "abstract": "The optimization of general oilfield development problems is considered. Techniques are presented to simultaneously determine the optimal number and type of new wells, the sequence in which they should be drilled, and their corresponding locations and (time-varying) controls. The optimization is posed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and involves categorical, integer-valued, and real-valued variables. The formulation handles bound, linear, and nonlinear constraints, with the latter treated with filter-based techniques. Noninvasive derivative-free approaches are applied for the optimizations. Methods considered include branch and bound (B&B), a rigorous global-search procedure that requires relaxation of the categorical variables; mesh adaptive direct search (MADS), a local pattern-search method; particle swarm optimization (PSO), a heuristic global-search method; and a PSO-MADS hybrid. Four example cases involving channelized-reservoir models are presented. The recently developed PSO-MADS hybrid is shown to consistently outperform the standalone MADS and PSO procedures. In the two cases in which B&B is applied, the heuristic PSO-MADS approach is shown to give comparable solutions but at much lower computational cost. This is significant since B&B provides a systematic search in the categorical variables. We conclude that, although it is demanding in terms of computation, the methodology presented here, with PSO-MADS as the core optimization method, appears to be applicable for realistic reservoir development and management.",

The paper describes the existing international early warning systems and response mechanisms, discusses the role of international organisations in managing diseases that have the potential for cross-border spread, and underlines the importance of disease surveillance, detection and response at national level. While international collaboration exists in dealing with disease emergency situations, there is a need to develop regional and international contingency plans that can be launched as soon as an emergency situation arises. This will only be possible if there is the political will to tackle problems wherever they occur. The Global Early Warning System, which is a system currently being developed jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Organisation for Animal Health and the World Health Organization, could provide an effective framework in which to achieve a higher level of international emergency preparedness.",

The precursor clouds to such systems are,\r\nhowever, rare due to their large initial gas mass reservoirs and rapid\r\ndispersal timescales due to stellar feedback. Nonetheless, unlike their high-z\r\ncounterparts, these precursors are resolvable down to the sites of individually\r\nforming stars, and hence represent the ideal environments in which to test the\r\ncurrent theories of star and cluster formation. Using high angular resolution\r\n(1$^\\prime\\prime$ / 0.05pc) and sensitivity ALMA observations of two YMC\r\nprogenitor clouds in the Galactic Centre, we have identified a suite of\r\nmolecular line transitions -- e.g. c-C$_3$H$_2 $($7-6$) -- that are\r\nbelieved to be optically thin, and reliably trace the gas structure in the\r\nhighest density gas on star-forming core scales. We conduct a virial analysis\r\nof the identified core and proto-cluster regions, and show that half of the\r\ncores (5/10) and both proto-clusters are unstable to gravitational collapse.\r\nThis is the first kinematic evidence of global gravitational collapse in YMC\r\nprecursor clouds at such an early evolutionary stage. The implications are that\r\nif these clouds are to form YMCs, then they likely do so via the\r\n\"conveyor-belt\" mode, whereby stars continually form within dispersed dense gas\r\ncores as the cloud undergoes global gravitational collapse. The concurrent\r\ncontraction of both the cluster-scale gas and embedded (proto)stars ultimately\r\nleads to the high (proto)stellar density in YMCs.",

While it is not yet clear what causes some galaxies to be strong\r\nC III emitters, CIII emission is not a universal property of distant\r\nstar-forming galaxies. We also examine C III emission in 46 star-forming\r\ngalaxies in the local universe, using archival spectra from GHRS, FOS, and STIS\r\non HST, and IUE. Twenty percent of these local galaxies show strong C III\r\nemission, with equivalent widths <-5 A. Three nearby galaxies show C III\r\nemission equivalent widths as large as the most extreme emitters yet observed\r\nin the distant universe; all three are Wolf-Rayet galaxies. At all redshifts,\r\nstrong C III emission may pick out low-metallicity galaxies experiencing\r\nintense bursts of star formation.

In this paper we introduce\r\ntime-varying chromatic ionospheric effects on simulated antenna temperature\r\ndata of a global 21-cm data analysis pipeline, and try to detect the injected\r\nglobal signal. We demonstrate that given turbulent ionospheric conditions, more\r\nthan 5\\% error in our knowledge of the ionospheric parameters could lead to\r\ncomparatively low evidence and high root-mean-square error (RMSE), suggesting a\r\nfalse or null detection. When using a constant antenna beam for cases that\r\ninclude data at different times, the significance of the detection lowers as\r\nthe number of time samples increases. It is also shown that for observations\r\nthat include data at different times, readjusting beam configurations according\r\nto the time-varying ionospheric conditions should greatly improve the\r\nsignificance of a detection, yielding higher evidences and lower RMSE, and that\r\nit is a necessary procedure for a successful detection when the ionospheric\r\nconditions are not ideal.",

We use the Lagrangian multipliers method in a\nHilbert manifold setting, which leads to a characterization of the abnormal\nextremizers (critical points of the endpoint map) as curves where the linear\nconstraint fails to be regular. Finally, we describe a modification of a result\nby Liu and Sussmann that shows the global distance minimizing property of\nsufficiently small portions of normal extremizers between a point and a\nsubmanifold.",

The analysis relies on\r\nsimulations of a clumpy galaxy at $z=2$ and the observed DYNAMO sample of rare\r\nclumpy analogs at $z\\approx0.1$ to test a predictive clump size scaling\r\nproposed by Fisher2017ApJ...839L...5F in the context of the Violent\r\nDisk Instability (VDI) theory. We here determine the clump sizes using a\r\nrecently presented 2-point estimator, which is robust against resolution/noise\r\neffects, hierarchical clump substructure, clump-clump overlap and other\r\ngalactic substructure. After verifying Fisher's clump scaling relation for the\r\nDYNAMO observations, we explore whether this relation remains characteristic of\r\nthe VDI theory, even if realistic physical processes, such as local asymetries\r\nand stellar feedback, are included in the model. To this end, we rely on\r\nhydrodynamic zoom-simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with four different\r\nfeedback prescriptions. We find that, during its marginally stable epoch at\r\n$z=2$, this mock galaxy falls on the clump scaling relation, although its\r\nposition on this relation depends on the feedback model. This finding implies\r\nthat Toomre-like stability considerations approximately apply to large\r\n($\\simkpc$) instabilities in marginally stable turbulent disks,\r\nirrespective of the feedback model, but also emphasizes that the global clump\r\ndistribution of a turbulent disk depends strongly on feedback.",

Concrete is made up of naturally\r\noccurring material such as Cement, Aggregate and Water.\r\nThe cement is major ingredient of concrete and due to rapid\r\nproduction of cement, various environmental problems are\r\noccurred i.e. Emission of green house gases such as CO2. The\r\nproduction of Portland cement is energy intensive.\r\nGlobal warming gas is released when the raw\r\nmaterial of cement, limestone and clay is crushed and heated\r\nin a furnace at high temperature of about 1500\u2019C. Each year\r\napproximately 1.89 billion tons of cement has been produced\r\nworld wide.\r\nEvery one ton of cement produced lead to about 0.9\r\ntons of CO 2 emission and a typical cubic yard of concrete\r\ncontains about 10% by weight of cement. There have been a\r\nnumber of article/ papers written about reducing the CO2\r\nemission from concrete. Preliminary through the use of lower\r\namount of cement and higher amount of supplementary\r\ncementanius material such as GGBS.\r\nThe researchers are currently found on use of waste\r\nmaterial having cementations properties which can be added\r\nin cement concrete as a partial replacement of cement\r\nwithout compromising its strength and durability which\r\nresult in decreases in cement production thus reduction in\r\nemission in green house gases i.e.CO2.The main purpose of\r\nthis research will solve using minimum quantity of cement\r\nand replace balance quantity with other cementanious\r\nmaterial. In addition to that the byproduct of industries will\r\nbe utilized which is harmful to environmental also and\r\nmanagement of waste will be easily achieved.\r\nThe ground granulated blast furnace slag is a waste\r\nproduct from iron manufacturing industry which may be\r\nused as partial replacement of cement in concrete due to its\r\ninherent cementanious properties. This paper presents\r\nexperimental study of compressive and flexural strength of\r\nconcrete prepared with ordinary Portland cement and PPC\r\npartial replaced by GGBS in different proportions varying\r\nfrom 0 % to 100 %. It is observed from investigation that the\r\nstrength of concrete is inversely proportional to the 40% of\r\nreplacement of cement with GGBS.\r\nIn this research effect of partial replacement of\r\ncement with GGBS on strength development of concrete and\r\ncured under summer and winter curing environments is\r\nestablished. Three levels of cement substitution i.e., 0% to\r\n100% have been selected. Early-age strength of GGBS\r\nconcrete is lower than the normal PC concrete which limits\r\nits use in the fast-track construction and post-tensioned\r\nbeams which are subjected to high early loads. The strength\r\ngain under winter curing condition was observed as slower.\r\nBy keeping the water cement ratio low as 0.35, concrete\r\ncontaining GGBS up to 100% can achieve high early-age\r\nstrength. GGBS concrete gains more strength than the PC\r\nconcrete after the age of 28 day till 90 day. The mechanical\r\nproperties of blended concrete for various levels of cement\r\nreplacement have been observed as higher than control\r\nconcrete mix having no GGBS.\r\nCement is major constituent material of the\r\nconcrete which produced by natural raw material like lime\r\nand silica. Once situation may occurs there will be no lime on\r\nearth for production of cement. This situation leads to think\r\nall people working in construction industry to do research\r\nwork on cement replacing material and use of it. Industrial\r\nwastes like Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS)\r\nshow chemical properties similar to cement. Use of GGBS as\r\ncement replacement will simultaneously reduces cost of\r\nconcrete and help to reduce rate of cement consumption. This\r\nstudy report of strength analysis of GGBS concrete will give\r\nassurance to encourage people working in the construction\r\nindustry for the beneficial use of it.",

This opens the possibility to compare the trend to the warming predicted by comprehensive climate models (GCMs), which up to now could not be verified directly to observations on a local scale, because the signal-to-noise ratio was too low. The observed temperature trend in western Europe over the last decades appears much stronger than simulated by state-of-the-art GCMs. The difference is very unlikely due to random fluctuations, either in fast weather processes or in decadal climate fluctuations. In winter and spring, changes in atmospheric circulation are important; in spring and summer changes in soil moisture and cloud cover. A misrepresentation of the North Atlantic Current affects trends along the coast. Many of these processes ontinue to affect trends in projections for the 21st century. This implies that climate predictions for western Europe probably underestimate the effects of anthropogenic climate change.",

These models focus on the sequence of steps used by developers to create reliable software. Though these process- models have helped companies to gain certification and attain global standards, they don't take into account interpersonal interactions and various other social aspects of software development organizations. In this paper we tackle one crucial part of the Coordination problem in Software Development, namely the problem of task assignment in a team. We propose a methodology to test a hypothesis based on how social networks can be used to improve coordination in Software Industry. In a pilot case study based on 4 teams of Masters Student working in a globally distributed environment (Holland and India), the social network structures along with the task distribution in each of the teams were analyzed. In each case we observed patterns, which could be used to test many hypotheses on team coordination and task allocation between them.",

In fact, these â\u0080\u0099clinesâ\u0080\u0099 can explain most of the variation in human populations. Despite this, population genetics inferences often rely on models that do not take geography into account, which could result in misleading conclusions when working at global geographic scales. Geographically explicit approaches have great potential for the study of human population genetics. Here, we discuss the most promising avenues of research in the context of human settlement history and the detection of genomic elements under natural selection. We also review recent technical advances and address the challenges of integrating geography and genetics.",

         "abstract": "The development of a risk assessment methodology reflects the different stages of the disaster management cycle (warning chain and response phase). Consequently the risk components hazard, exposure (e.g. how many people are exposed?), susceptibility (e.g. are the people able to receive a warning?), coping capacity (are the people able to evacuate?) and recovery (are the people able to restore their livelihoods?) are addressed and quantified. Thereby, the risk assessment encompasses three steps: (i) identifying the nature, location, intensity and probability of a threat (hazard assessment); (ii) determining the existence and degree of vulnerabilities and exposure to those threats (e.g. the physical and socio-economic spheres) and (iii) identifying the coping capacities and resources available to address or manage threats.\nThe assessment methodology presented follows a people-centered assessment approach to deliver relevant risk and vulnerability information for the purposes of early warning and disaster management considering the entire coastal areas of Sumatra, Java and Bali facing the Sunda trench. Thereby it is demonstrated how to characterise and quantify risk and vulnerability components as hazard intensity, people and critical infrastructure exposed, their susceptibility and coping capacity. Additionally, dedicated products like maps, guidelines and other information products are developed according to end user needs.\nThe currently established risk assessment results cover the entire coast of Sumatra, Java and Bali facing the Sunda trench. This information on the location of high, moderate and low tsunami risk areas is available on different scales (down to 1 : 100 000 map scale) and aggregation levels (e.g. desa / warning segments). Furthermore the assessed risk information and products are integrated in the database of the Early Warning Center to be used for decision support. To link national scale decision making whether to warn or not in case of a tsunami occurence, the risk products can also be provided to local level decision makers to react adequately concerning their local risks.",

         "abstract": "Case-systems all over the world exhibit striking similarities. In most lan-guages intransitive subjects (S) receives less overt marking than one of thetwo transitive arguments (agent-like A or patient-like P); the other one ofthese two arguments is usually encoded by the same form as S. In somelanguages the amount of overt marking is identical between S, A, and P.But hardly ever does the S argument receive more overt marking than Aor P. Yet there are some languages that do not follow this general pattern.This book is about those languages that behave differently, the marked-Slanguages.Marked-S languages are well-known to be found in East Africa, wherethey occur in two different language families, Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Sa-haran. They can also be found in North-Western America and the Pacificregion. This book is the first investigation of marked S-languages thattreats the phenomenon on a global scale.The study examines the functional distribution of the two main case-forms, the form used for S (S-case) and the case-form of the transitive ar-gument which receives less marking (the zero-case). It offers a very fine-grained perspective considering a wide range of constructions. The con-texts in which the case-marking patterns are investigated include nom-inal, existential and locational predication, subjects in special discoursefunction (e. g. focused constituents), subjects of passives and dependentclauses, as well as the forms used for addressing someone (vocative form)and for using a noun in isolation (citation form).Apart from the functional distribution of case forms, the formal meansof marking are also considered. The main focus is on the synchronic de-scription and comparison of marked-S languages, but historical explana-tions for the unusual case-marking pattern are also discussed.",

The key idea of our work is, based on calculation of nodes coverage, we can let networks be adaptive to ongoing changing network situation. We use system working life as our criterion in this work to demonstrate the potential usage of our system. An algebraic topology tool, homology, is used in our work to calculate sensor nodes coverage since the local properties of a sensor network, obtained by local interactions among nodes, can be captured by certain topological spaces. Also the global properties of the sensor network characteristics correspond to certain topological invariants of these spaces. Unlike other approaches, our work does not need any node location or orientation information and it does not have any assumption about the node deployment control and domain geometry. The only thing that it needs to calculate nodes coverage is a peer to peer communication graph.",
