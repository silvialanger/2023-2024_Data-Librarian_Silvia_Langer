It will investigate how authorities go about purchasing green goods and services as well as the most effective way to share best practice. It will explore the leadership role of councils in encouraging individuals, communities and businesses to reduce their emissions. Members will also consult with authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

Without a name, we have no concept and without a concept we cannot combat it.   This is why I searched for a new word.\"\r\n\"The real problem is that we are faced with determined, well-organised adversaries who care nothing about human rights or climate change; who would probably laugh at the very mention of geocide.  They want only one thing: business as usual and a world in which they can make endless amounts of money using any and all available resources, no matter what the costs to nature and to human life.  Unless we can accept this reality and confront these adversaries, as well as the public and private organisations they serve, I\u2019m afraid we have no hope of ultimately preventing geocide.\"",

The report concludes that: warming of the climate system is unequivocal; human influence on the climate system has been the dominant cause; limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained emission reductions; and atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, already at levels not observed in at least 800,000 years, will persist for centuries to come.",

The report was commissioned by Gen. Milley during his previous role as the Army\u2019s Chief of Staff. It was made publicly available in August via the Center for Climate and Security, but didn't get a lot of attention at the time.\r\nBizarrely for a report styling itself around the promotion of environmental stewardship in the Army, the report identifies the Arctic as a critical strategic location for future US military involvement: to maximize fossil fuel consumption.",

         "description" : "Global emissions scenarios play a critical role in the assessment of strategies to mitigate climate change. The current scenarios, however, are criticized because they feature strategies with pronounced overshoot of the global temperature goal, requiring a long-term repair phase to draw temperatures down again through net-negative emissions. Some impacts might not be reversible. Hence, we explore a new set of net-zero CO2 emissions scenarios with limited overshoot. We show that upfront investments are needed in the near term for limiting temperature overshoot but that these would bring long-term economic gains. Our study further identifies alternative configurations of net-zero CO2 emissions systems and the roles of different sectors and regions for balancing sources and sinks. Even without net-negative emissions, CO2 removal is important for accelerating near-term reductions and for providing an anthropogenic sink that can offset the residual emissions in sectors that are hard to abate. Current emissions scenarios include pathways that overshoot the temperature goals set out in the Paris Agreement and rely on future net negative emissions. Limiting overshoot would require near-term investment but would result in longer-term economic benefit.",

         "description" : "\r\n\r\nThis review addresses the causes of observed climate variations across the industrial period, from 1750 to present. It focuses on long-term changes, both in response to external forcing and to climate variability in the ocean and atmosphere. A synthesis of results from attribution studies based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions covering the recent few centuries to the 20th century, and instrumental data shows how greenhouse gases began to cause warming since the beginning of industrialization, causing trends that are attributable to greenhouse gases by 1900 in proxy-based temperature reconstructions. Their influence increased over time, dominating recent trends. However, other forcings have caused substantial deviations from this emerging greenhouse warming trend: volcanic eruptions have caused strong cooling following a period of unusually heavy activity, such as in the early 19th century; or warming during periods of low activity, such as in the early-to-mid 20th century. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing most likely masked some global greenhouse warming over the 20th century, especially since the accelerated increase in sulphate aerosol emissions starting around 1950. Based on modelling and attribution studies, aerosol forcing has also influenced regional temperatures, caused long-term changes in monsoons and imprinted on Atlantic variability. Multi-decadal variations in atmospheric modes can also cause long-term climate variability, as apparent for the example of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and have influenced Atlantic ocean variability. Long-term precipitation changes are more difficult to attribute to external forcing due to spatial sparseness of data and noisiness of precipitation changes, but the observed pattern of precipitation response to warming from station data supports climate model simulated changes and with it, predictions. The long-term warming has also led to significant differences in daily variability as, for example, visible in long European station data. Extreme events over the historical record provide valuable samples of possible extreme events and their mechanisms.\r\n",

Men det var vÃ¤ldigt kallt..Â  Citat: \"... it's part of the insanity of our moment that the preservation of our planet as we have known it, which should be the great conservative issue of our era, is now pure poison on the right. \" \"...The end of the world may be popular in fiction, but in everyday life, I suspect, the apocalypse is the version of the future that it's hardest to mobilize around. Â If the prospect is that it's already hopeless, that the suffering is going to be largely down the line, that we're all going down anyway, and the planet will simply be destroyed, well, why bother? Â Why not focus on what matters to you now and forget the rest? Â This is where denial, the almost involuntary turning away from unpalatable futures that seem beyond our power or ability to alter, comes into play. Â If the future is essentially over before it begins, then better to ignore it and go about your still palatable enough daily life.\" Sidan innehÃ¥ller Ã¤ven reklam fÃ¶r Engelhardts bok \"The End of Victory Culture\"",

But climate change also takes a significant toll on mental health, according to a new report released by the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica entitled \"Mental Health and Our Changing Climate: Impacts, Implications, and GuidanceÂ (PDF, 1.24MB).\"\r\nClimate change-induced severe weather and other natural disasters have the most immediate effects on mental health in the form of the trauma and shock due to personal injuries, loss of a loved one, damage to or loss of personal property or even the loss of livelihood, according to the report. Terror, anger, shock and other intense negative emotions that can dominate people\u2019s initial response may eventually subside, only to be replaced by post-traumatic stress disorder.",

Cutting the pollution of those gasses that lead to climate change is urgent and involves doing many things. Overcoming unemployment and giving decent work to our people is just as urgent. By placing the interests of workers and the poor at the forefront of strategies to combat climate change we can simultaneously halt climate change and address our jobs bloodbath. This is why we campaign for our government to create a million climate jobs now. Our demand is based on well-researched solutions for how South Africa can immediately begin a just transition to a low carbon economy. + 7 point program",

If it were a country, the United States military\u2019s emissions alone would make it the world\u2019s 55th largest contributor.\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not only energy consumption used for using and moving troops and weapons that have devastating impacts on the climate. The impact goes far beyond it. The entire lifecycle of weapons\u2019 production, testing, and use, from small arms to explosive or nuclear weapons, have huge repercussions for biodiversity, soil, groundwater, and air. The ever-increasing military expenditure, skyrocketing in 2020 to almost $2 trillion, diverts crucial resources for ecological regeneration and climate change mitigation, food security, housing, and healthcare.\r\n\r\nHowever, most governments refuse to connect the dots between military activity and environmental impacts. \u201CThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change obliges signatories to publish annual GHG emissions, but military emissions reporting is voluntary and often not included,\u201D observes the Conflict and Environment Observatory (CEOBS) in its call for action. Similarly, the UN General Assembly First Committee on Disarmament and International that just recently concluded its annual five-week session, has not yet shown any signs of meaningfully integrating ecological considerations into its work on disarmament and arms control.",

         "description" : "\r\n\r\nDependence between extreme rainfall and storm surge can have significant implications for coastal floods, which are often caused by joint occurrence of these flood drivers (through pluvial or fluvial processes). The effect of multiple drivers leading to a compound flood event poses higher risk than those caused by a single flood-driving process. There is strong evidence that compound floods caused by joint occurrence of extreme storm surge and heavy rainfall are related to meteorological forcing (e.g. large scale pressure systems and wind) and climate phenomena (e.g. the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation or ENSO). Therefore, understanding how climate phenomena affect the co-occurrence of coastal flood drivers is an important step towards understanding future coastal flood risk under climate change. Here we examine the impact of one of the most important climate phenomena\u2014ENSO\u2014on dependence between storm surge and rainfall in Australia, using both observed surge and modelled surge from a linked ocean-climate model\u2014the Regional Ocean Modeling System. Our results show that ENSO has a significant impact on the dependence between extreme rainfall and storm surge, thus flood risk resulted from these drivers. The overall dependence is largely driven by La NiÃ±a in Australia, with increased dependence observed during La NiÃ±a along most of the Australian coastline. However, there can be increased dependence during El NiÃ±o in some locations. The results demonstrate dependence is contributed by unequally-weighted mechanisms due to the interaction between climate phenomena and local features, indicating the need for greater understanding of composition of compound flood risk. Where climate phenomena are anticipated to change into the future, it is possible to use integrated process-driven models to establish a better understanding of whether extremes are more likely to co-occur and exacerbate compound flood risk.\r\n",

         "user" : "simon.brown",
         "description" : "Many countries rely on regional climate model (RCM) projections to quantify the impacts of climate change and to design their adaptation plans accordingly. In several European regions, RCMs project a smaller temperature increase than global climate models (GCMs), which is hypothesised to be due to discrepant representations of topography, cloud processes, or aerosol forcing in RCMs and GCMs. Additionally, RCMs do generally not consider the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations; a process which is, however, included in most GCMs. Plants adapt to higher CO2 concentrations by closing their stomata, which can lead to reduced transpiration with concomitant surface warming, in particular, during temperature extremes. Here we show that embedding plant physiological responses to elevated CO2 concentrations in an RCM leads to significantly higher projected extreme temperatures in Europe. Annual maximum temperatures rise additionally by about 0.6 K (0.1 K in southern, 1.2 K in northern Europe) by 2070\u20132099, explaining about 67% of the stronger annual maximum temperature increase in GCMs compared to RCMs. Missing plant physiological CO2 responses thus strongly contribute to the underestimation of temperature trends in RCMs. The need for robust climate change assessments calls for a comprehensive implementation of this process in RCM land surface schemes.",

Local-level government authorities have sought to communicate via social media, but little is known about their communication strategies and citizens\u2019 participation in replying to their publications. This study draws on conceptual frameworks for Social Media Presence and Human Engagement to establish behavioural modelling and topic modelling approaches for assessing citizen-authority communication from a long-term perspective. Empirical analyses focus on official government authorities for the Brazilian cities of SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and BelÃ©m, which cover over 25 million people and 500 thousand followers on the X platform (former Twitter). Analyses are based on 10.2 thousand authorities\u2019 publications and their 5.5 thousand received replies from 2.6 thousand people over one year. Findings show that authorities use periodic passive posting, providing meteorological, hydrological, and geological alerts, forecasts, and momentary weather updates. Citizen engagement is short-term, providing corrections, additions, and updates but not connecting weather events with climate change. Practice-oriented implications concern the adequacy of social media for providing citizens awareness, keeping them updated, and building their trust in authorities over climate event developments.",

Man habe jetzt schon 10 Jahre an Zeit verloren, in denen Ã¼ber die KlimaerwÃ¤rmung gesprochen, aber nicht entschieden gehandelt wurde. Es sei jetzt hÃ¶chste Zeit, bindende EmissionsbeschrÃ¤nkungen und MaÃnahmen zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel einzufÃ¼hren, um die zu erwartenden SchÃ¤den zu mindern. Im Blick haben sie die UN-Klimatagung im Juni in Bonn, den G8-Gipfel im Juli in Japan und vor allem die Klimakonferenz 2009 in Kopenhagen, wo es um das Kyoto-Nachfolgeabkommen geht.\r\n\r\nDie Wissenschaftler, die am Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) der Vereinten Nationen beteiligt sind, erklÃ¤ren, dass sie mit ihrer Warnung, die in Nature Reports Climate Change erschienen ist, nicht offiziell im Namen des Klimarats sprechen. Jetzt, so sagen sie, wÃ¼rde man bereits mit den steigenden Lebensmittelpreisen die ersten \"globalen Auswirkungen\" der KlimaerwÃ¤rmung beobachten kÃ¶nnen. Sie seien auf Trockenheiten in HerstellerlÃ¤ndern wie Australien und auf \"schlecht konzipierte Experimente der Klimapolitik\" zurÃ¼ckzufÃ¼hren, die AnbauflÃ¤chen fÃ¼r Lebensmittel zu BiospritflÃ¤chen gemacht hÃ¤tten. \"Dies sollte uns als Weckruf dienen: Folgen des Klimawandels kÃ¶nnen uns Ã¼berraschen, besonders wenn sie in Verbindung mit anderen Trends zusammenwirken.\"",

The highlight is that information avoidance seems to be driven by positive affect, while information seeking seems to be more heavily influenced by negative affect. Another interesting finding is that informational subjective norms are positively related to both seeking and avoidance, which suggests that one\u2019s social environment has the potential to strongly influence the way he or she handles climate change information.

The most obvious obstacle is the company's current reliance on natural gas as a fuel source. Not only are its installations dependent on the availability of distribution infrastructure, but Bloom also likely will be called upon more often to discuss how it handles methane, a super pollutant associated with natural gas and biogas that is a more potent contributor to global warming than carbon dioxide.",

         "user" : "cschie",
         "description" : "There is, or should be, a distinction between adaption and agility.  Adaption \u2013 minor change - can be seen as  an entire range of small changes that you undertake to increase effectiveness and/or efficiency, from substituting one piece of equipment for another (or using bailing wire and bubblegum to fix something) through to adjusting tactical and even operational methods.  It is the later which is of prime interest with respect to agility, this being a mindset (or intellectual outlook) that allows, as Rob says, to better and more quickly identify changes in the environment and exploit the opportunities that occur as a result or at least adjust to minimize the adverse consequences.  An example that Rob and I discussed was the mental agility to recognize and seize appropriately the opportunity afforded by some Sunni insurgent groups turning against al Qaeda in Iraq (Cavguy \u2013 I think it was he - and Kilcullen have both discussed this on SWB) and then adaptation was to be able to transfer the basic model to other areas while adjusting the model appropriately to fit the local situation and circumstances (and yes, recognizing different circumstances and adjusting the model falls under agility as well).  So, another, and perhaps better, way to think about the difference between adaptability and agility is that adaptation is the ability to react to obvious change and/or problem, while agility is the capacity to discern change and, more important, its implications, so that you are able to anticipate and act in an anticipatory manner (preferably appropriately).  Rob\u2019s boxer analogy captures this.\r\n\r\nTurning to innovation, methinks my beers\u2019 explanation was only partial. So allow me to elaborate. Innovation, as I as an academic define it, is major change in aims, strategies (ways of warfare), and/or structure.  As an example, institutionalizing maneuver warfare is a major change (operational way of warfare), and as such has implications for the other two main aspects noted earlier as well as throughout an organization and for resources.  (So, I would guess that davidfpo's obervation about change in LE would in my definition be 'adaptation')\r\n\r\nWhere my beer probably mis-explained was in the context of what Rob and I were talking about \u2013 institutionalizing IW or Complex IW (or hybrid warfare, if you will \u2013 a mix of conventional and unconventional [ie, Hezbollah, summer 2006]) as a core competency of the US military (or specific services, if you prefer).  A key element of developing a CIW competency, for the US military (and I concur with this) is agility and adaptability.  So, in the context of this, Rob\u2019s observation \u2018\u201CInnovation\u201D as the steps taken to create and sustain the broader climate or atmosphere in which \u201CAdaptation\u201D takes place\u2019 is correct, as \u2018part\u2019 of institutionalizing CIW.   The effort to implement and institutionalize CIW will, in part, involve creating and sustaining a broader climate or atmosphere (or to be academic, organizational culture) through persuasion (narratives), education and training (behavior), in which mental agility can be fostered, and to the degree that it is fostered this will improve adaptability.  Fostering improved mental agility and/or agility in and of itself would not constitute major change or innovation, even though it would be organizationally very useful,  rather in the context of Rob\u2019s and my conversation it is an important component of implementing CIW which would be a major change or innovation.\r\n  \r\nOf course, fostering agility is not easy (agility takes experience, education, training, and so on and so forth), and nor should we expect that every enlisted, NCO and/or officer will be agile, for human nature is such that some people tend to be more mentally agile than others.  It seems to me that to develop agility you need to start right in enlisted and officer \u2018boot camp\u2019, whereas my limited, \u2018book based\u2019, understanding of \u2018boot camp\u2019 is that part of the training /socialization process is to inculcate \u2018obedience to command\u2019 (among a host of other attributes), which I suspect works to rigidify thinking (but I am guessing on this observation).  How one balances a desire for mental agility with the necessity of \u2018obedience to command\u2019 is beyond my competence and I leave this to the psychologists and sociologists (and anthropologists? and ?) to mull over.",

The affluent citizens of the world are responsible for most environmental impacts and are central to any future prospect of retreating to safer environmental conditions. We summarise the evidence and present possible solution approaches. Any transition towards sustainability can only be effective if far-reaching lifestyle changes complement technological advancements. However, existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption expansion and the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits necessary societal change. Current environmental impact mitigation neglects over-consumption from affluent citizens as aÂ primary driver. The authors highlight the role of bottom-up movements to overcome structural economic growth imperatives spurring consumption by changing structures and culture towards safe and just systems.",

Speakers include: Michael T.

The book gives context to the discussion at\r\nhand, reflecting on why people are not well served by nation-states when\r\nthey continuously seek to out-compete one another in the size and\r\ndestructive powers of their militaries. The webinar  deals with the\r\nscope of military spending around the world, while explaining how militarism\r\nis linked with conflict and security threats, and how military spending\r\nfurther prevent us from adequately dealing with global problems such as\r\nclimate change or the covid-19 pandemic.",

When we make that connection and feel the hurts of the planet, grief is unavoidable.\r\nWe no longer have to conjoin environmentalism with faith in Big Science and institutional authority, implying that if only people had more trust in the authorities (in this case scientific, but it extends to all the systems that embed and legitimize the institution of science) then things would be fine. You know what? Even if the \u201Cclimate change deniers\u201D are right, it wouldn\u2019t alter my environmental passion one bit.

         "user" : "simon.brown",
         "description" : "The intensity of the heaviest extreme precipitation events is known to increase with global warming. How often such events occur in a warmer world is however less well established, and the combined effect of changes in frequency and intensity on the total amount of rain falling as extreme precipitation is much less explored, in spite of potentially large societal impacts. Here, we employ observations and climate model simulations to document strong increases in the frequencies of extreme precipitation events occurring on decadal timescales. Based on observations we find that the total precipitation from these intense events almost doubles per degree of warming, mainly due to changes in frequency, while the intensity changes are relatively weak, in accordance to previous studies. This shift towards stronger total precipitation from extreme events is seen in observations and climate models, and increases with the strength \u2013 and hence the rareness \u2013 of the event. Based on these results, we project that if historical trends continue, the most intense precipitation events observed today are likely to almost double in occurrence for each degree of further global warming. Changes to extreme precipitation of this magnitude are dramatically stronger than the more widely communicated changes to global mean precipitation.",

         "description" : "Theme: Global Governance - Political Authority in Transition\r\n\r\nThe nation-state is generally regarded as inadequate to cope with the expanding global problems of the 21st century. Global climate change, international economic crises, transnational terrorism and crime, pandemics, nuclear proliferation, and more, all challenge the capabilities of states individually and collectively. Nation-states are also challenged from below by secessionist and other sub-national movements and from above by global civil society. In response to these competing pressures, political authority has begun to flow upwards to supranational or multilateral bodies, downwards to regional and local governments, and sideways to private actors \u2013 both within nations and transnationally \u2013 who assume previously public responsibilities. Governance is no longer the exclusive preserve of sovereign states, if it ever was. But neither is it moving uniformly in a single direction. Despite growing interest in problems of global governance and decades of research, four key questions still lack clear answers. Where is political authority moving? Why is authority moving? Is global governance good? How can global governance be improved and reformed?\r\n\r\nWe invite proposals for papers and panels that address these and other issues related to the problems of global governance in the 21st century. We especially welcome proposals that bridge different theoretical, epistemological and ontological divides within international studies to address common substantive problems.\r\n\r\nDEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS IS JUNE 1, 2010\r\nAll proposals should be submitted online using the MyISA Conference Management System at http://isanet.ccit.arizona.edu/MyISA\r\nProgram Chairs contact information:\r\nEmail: isa2011@isanet.org",

         "user" : "mikaelbook",
         "description" : "Brill\r\nAbstract In recent years the age-old question \u201Cwhat is the human?\u201D has acquired a new acuteness and novel dimensions. In introducing the special issue on \u201CHistorical Thinking and the Human\u201D, this article argues that there are two main trends behind the contemporary \u201Ccrisis of human\u201D: ecological transformations (related to human-induced climate change and planetary environmental challenges), and technological ones (including advancements in human enhancement, biotechnology and artificial intelligence). After discussing the respective anthropocenic and technoscientific redefinitions of the human, the paper theorizes three elements in an emerging new historicity of the human: first, the move from a fixed category to a dynamic and indeterminate concept, considering the human as a lifeform in movement; second, the extent to which the human is conceived of in its relational dependence on various non-human agents, organic and non-organic; and third, the reconceptualization of the human not as one but as many, to comprehend that we cannot speak of human individuality in the classical biological sense. In the final part, the article addresses the consequences of the redefinition of the human for historical thinking. It makes the case for the need to elaborate a new notion of history \u2013 captured by the phrase \u201Cmore-than-human history\u201D, and attuned to an emerging planetary regime of historicity in which historical thinking becomes able to affirm multiple temporalities: digital, technoscientific, sociocultural, human, biological and anthropocenic. The article concludes by recognizing the necessity to venture into a new transdisciplinary knowledge economy, appropriate for making sense of the contemporary constellation of the entangled human, technological and natural worlds.\r\n",

Here, we analyze the first ever global climate simulations to resolve such mesoscale dynamics of extratropical cyclones. The present\u2010day structure, frequency, and precipitation of the oceanic extratropical cyclones compare well with reanalyses and new satellite datasets that resolve the multiscale cloud\u2010precipitation system. Simulated precipitation from intense oceanic cyclones increases at a rate of 7%/K1, following Clausius\u2010Clapeyron, with warming. The same scaling is apparent also in the interhemispheric contrast, suggesting that the latter could serve as a predictor of the former. Projected changes in precipitation from intense oceanic cyclones with warming may thus be testable using a reliable global observation network of precipitation in the present day.",

         "description" : "The Society for Old Age Rational Suicide was established in Brighton and Hove, by several right-to-die activists and humanists, in 2009. Presently, the main objective of SOARS is to begin a campaign to get the law eventually changed in the UK so that very elderly, mentally competent individuals, who are suffering unbearably from various health problems (although none of them is \u201Cterminal\u201D) are allowed to receive a doctor\u2019s assistance to die, if this is their persistent choice. Surely the decision to decide, at an advanced age, that enough is enough and, avoiding further suffering, to have a dignified death is the ultimate human right for a very elderly person. Although there is much public support for this to become lawful in the UK, it is unlikely that Parliament (either at Westminster or in Edinburgh) will change the law, to help those who are terminally ill, for at least five to ten years.",

Expressed concerns about piracy mask the actual intentions of the `Big Five' - control of all modes of distribution.

Soil maps are resources for researchers in many fields apart from soil science; they are the source of databases, related to and dependent on soils, used to monitor land degradation and improvement, changes in land use and water resources, and to predict climatic and other environmental changes. \r\n\r\nLess and less new, fundamental soil data are being produced these days; the older data and information are being pumped around more and more. Therefore it is vital to preserve the older data (in this case maps) as they are building blocks of most current soil information. The user of present-day, derived information should have easy access to the source material, if only to assess the reliability of the derived material. \r\n\r\nBut, in many countries, soil maps are being lost because of lack of proper attention to storage and retrieval, often compounded by a loss of institutions that have been responsible for the acquisition and maintenance of soil and land resources data. This problem is acute in developing and transitional countries where valuable data, currently only available on paper, must be digitized before they are lost forever.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, though not only in Africa, this type of information is rapidly being lost; much is already lost. The digitization of the African maps will enable the African countries to recover and re-use their soil information.\r\n\r\nTranslation of soil information from paper maps and reports into digital format is a prerequisite of the next step - the development of an information system on soil and terrain that may be drawn upon for manifold applications.

While proximate explanations for veteran mistrust have been proposed, the ultimate explanations lie within our evolved psychology, shaped as it was by a long evolutionary history of coalitionary violence between men. The exchange of signals of mutual commitment, especially in the context of violence, reflects important features of our evolved psychology. While such exchanges may have typified the small, cohesive social environments in which our brains evolved, those exchanges are comparatively lacking in the modern societies to which veterans return, resulting in what biologists describe as a phylogenic mismatch. This mismatch may underlie a variety of veteran reintegration problems. Though largely neglected in the literature, evolutionary explanations for PTSD sequelae among veterans offer invaluable insights for clinicians, family members, friends, or employers interfacing with veterans during their reintegration into peacetime civilian life.

A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine its ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. Routers perform the \"traffic directing\" functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it gets to its destination node.. When multiple routers are used in interconnected networks, the routers exchange information about destination addresses, using a dynamic routing protocol. Each router builds up a table listing the preferred routes between any two systems on the interconnected networks. A router has interfaces for different physical types of network connections, (such as copper cables, fiber optic, or wireless transmission). It also contains firmware for different networking protocol standards. Each network interface uses this specialized computer software to enable data packets to be forwarded from one protocol transmission system to another. Routers may also be used to connect two or more logical groups of computer devices known as subnets, each with a different sub-network address. The subnets addresses recorded in the router do not necessarily map directly to the physical interface connections..\"",

The IoE was already ranked as world-leading in education. But in a climate of squeezed research funding and highly competitive student recruitment, the merger was seen as a sensible move by many in the sector, who felt that smaller institutions might be at risk. The alliance crowned UCL as the biggest university in London, with more than 35,000 students, and the largest postgraduate institution in Britain. But two years on, angry educationists say they are underpaid and undervalued in their new institution. Last month John Yandell, president of the IoE branch of the University and College Union, delivered a petition signed by 1,000 staff and students to UCL\u2019s provost, Michael Arthur, calling for a rise in London weighting to match their UCL counterparts \u2013 IoE academics claim they are paid Â£600 less. He believes members struggle to cope with the high rent, mortgage and travel costs of living in the capital. But he isn\u2019t optimistic about their chances of being heard. With some modern universities suffering declines of up to 25% in student numbers, experts say an increase in university mergers is inevitable. \u201CThe main driver will be that some institutions will become financially unsustainable \u2013 if they aren\u2019t already,\u201D says Prof Roger Brown, former vice-chancellor of Southampton Solent University. Glynne Stanfield, head of the international higher education practice at law firm Eversheds, who has advised on several university mergers, says lower-ranking institutions that are not meeting student-number targets may well look for a partner. But he argues another likely scenario is that struggling universities may be taken over by private sector players waiting in the wings. \u201CWould the private s",

This is an interview technique used by journalists to get comments on the topics, which are not answered. (PRWEB) September 22, 2015 There's no doubt at all that aerial drones, when used legally by licensed professionals, deliver a huge amount of value to the real estate industry. Unfortunately, legislation has been continuously pushing to make it harder and more expensive to be licensed to legally use aerial drones , a situation that many in the industry view as being completely unacceptable. HomeJab, a growing national team of photographers and filmmakers, have decided to step up and try to reverse this trend announcing the launch of a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to support the legal use of aerial drones in real estate photography. Proceeds from the campaign will go towards getting local photographers and filmmakers approved and certified from the FAA with all required training, licensing and insurance. The early response to the news has been enthusiastic. This crowdfunding campaign can be life changing for the photographers and filmmakers who would able to be certified who otherwise may not have been able to pay the associated fees on their own, commented a spokesperson from HomeJab. Let's keep aerial drone use in real estate numbers growing. It's a huge benefit to the real estate industry. According to the company, a goal for the crowdfunding campaign has been set of $250,000. Depending on donation size, a significant discount is offered on aerial drone photography from HomeJab, well known for their remarkable work in this area. HomeJab serves the following areas: DC Metro, Philadelphia, Austin, Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Asheville, Greenville, Columbus, Omaha, Tucson, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego.

Based on reading other reviews, Ive gathered that the Phantom 3 set up is slightly more advanced, but I cant say for sure until Ive tried it. I can say that I was thrilled with the stills and video I shot from my Q500. The bonus CGO Steadygrip is also a blast. It was capable of keeping a smooth shot when I ran around the office chasing coworkers, though Im not sure how well it would fare on rough terrain. The device itself also feels a little bit cheap and requires eight rechargeable AA batteries. This felt especially annoying since you can charge everything else in the kit by plugging it into the wall. Like I honestly loved how easy it was to get familiar with the Q500. The fact that you can also buy a full kit with an aluminum case and extra batteries makes it seem like the best all-you-really-need drone package out there.

Any rattan previously grown on the land was the responsibility of Keresa Plantations itself, after clearing the natural forest on the land. An evaluation of publicly available documents shows that not only did Keresa Plantations have an effective lease to the land during the time it was deforested, the company recorded proceeds from the sale of timber between 1995 and 1999. Basic facts stated in publicly available financial records for Keresa Plantations seem to have been overlooked by RSPO auditors. According to official land transaction records from Sarawak, leaked by Sarawak Report , Keresa Plantations land in the Lavang Land District was allocated as a concession to the company with the purpose of cultivating rattan, a fast-growing non-timber species of vine found natively in South East Asia. Company financial statements indicate that both oil palm and rattan were developed in parallel beginning in 1996. Keresa Plantations financial reports make references to trial plantings for rattan being harvested as early as May 2000. If Keresa Plantations developed oil palm over land that previously hosted rattan planting, it should not be excluded from assessment of the companys responsibility for clearing forests, which satellite imagery confirms the land contained until its conversion under Keresa Plantations management. Satellite imagery from Landsat confirms that by 2005, much of the forest which previously covered the plantation had been cleared. One RSPO audit report for Keresa Plantations said that an independent bodyapproved by the RSPO as an assessor, had undertaken a HCV Assessment prior to development in 2005, and found an absence of protected, rare, or threatened species. An assessment in 2005, almost a decade after deforestation began, to evaluate whether high-conservation value (HCV) areas existed in the plantation is functionally meaningless. (To see Keresa Plantations' deforestation over time lapse imaging, click here for 1986-2002 and here for 2002-2010 .*) The forest cleared for oil palm plantings by Keresa Plantations was not untouched. However, the ample logging roads visible throughout the concession in satellite imagery, and the companys own sale of timber sourced there for several years show that, before clearance by the company, this forest was rich enough to support marketable tropical timber species. When an assessment of nearby smallholder lands was carried out in 2011, several endangered species [were] identified. The completion of the conversion on Keresa Plantations land from forest to plantation takes place around the same time the company was accepted as an ordinary member of the RSPO in 2009, led by director Graeme Brown.

Instead, Ill dissect the premiers claim that her carbon tax is revenue neutral and her methods are market friendly. The assertion reveals insincerity on taxes and slipshod ignorance on how markets work. The premiers $3-billion tax increase taxes every Albertan and everything. Unhelpfully, it will raise costs and make Alberta more expensive just as the market, to which the premier claims fealty, is literally marking goods and services down in price, this to balance an oversupply of goods and services with lower demand. This natural act between consenting market forces (over supply, meet lower demand) makes the price for all that stuff extra labour, idled oil rigs, unused office space more affordable. It keeps more people working than if costs stay boom-time high. So the process saves jobs, unless some other force artificially pushes up prices again which is where the provincial government comes in. The NDP premier claims her $3-billion tax is revenue neutral. But neutrality exists when a new tax is imposed and another one is reduced by the same amount. Thats opposite the provinces plan to keep much of its $3-billion carbon cash tax to later spend.

         "description" : "Mission\r\n\r\nThe Thermophysical Properties Division provides the best available measurements, theory, computations, and data evaluation for the thermophysical property information required to enable development of standards, enhance productivity, facilitate trade, ensure scientific and technological progress, and improve the quality of life.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nThe Thermophysical Properties Division (TPD) was formed at the beginning of 2008 by a reorganization which separated the old Physical and Chemical Properties Division into two entities with distinct focuses and each housed on one of the two main campuses of NIST. The TPD is a Division of the Material Measurement Laboratory located on the Boulder campus.\r\n\r\nThe Thermophysical Properties Division strives to be the foremost and best source of high quality thermophysical property information. This vision is driven by the ubiquitous importance of this information to commerce, industry, manufacturing, and national policy objectives. The Division meets its challenges through an integrated program of experimental measurement, data collection and evaluation, development of theoretically based models, and simulation of model systems. Among the outputs of the Division are computerized standard reference databases which synthesize thermophysical property information in forms which are conveniently used by our stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of commodity exchanges in chemicals, energy related fluids, and materials are based on physical and chemical properties. In some cases, national and international standards for these properties are needed, such as the AGA-8 equation of state for the properties of natural gas, ASME-IAPWS Properties of Water and Steam, ISO-Standard Equations for refrigerants. Generally these standards are presented in the form of high accuracy equations of state which allow determination of a wide range of thermodynamic properties. Additionally, performance criteria of working fluids, feedstock, chemicals, and cryogenic systems are inextricably linked to thermophysical properties, e.g. density, viscosity, boiling point, phase behavior, heat capacity, stability, etc. Engineering design, optimal operation, and innovation for engines, chemical manufacturing, power generation, heating and air conditioning, distillation, etc. depends critically on knowledge of these properties. Reliable properties data are critical to competitive advantage, sustainability, and innovation. Finally, we note that widespread reliance of industry on properties information, success in setting and achieving national energy, environmental, and security goals often requires an extensive and trustworthy properties information-base.\r\n\r\nTo meet the broad spectrum of needs, only briefly sketched above, the Division\u2019s work is structured along four synergistic themes:\r\n\r\n    * Develop and maintain the measurement capabilities, standard materials and reference data needed to underpin a national system of thermophysical property measurements;\r\n    * Develop large-scale, readily accessible data resources providing trustworthy property information meeting high priority needs for a broad range of industries and national agendas;\r\n    * Develop empirical and fundamental predictive capabilities to enable reliable estimation of property values when experimental data are unavailable; Research experimental techniques and address key data-gaps in support of specific, high priority industrial and national initiatives.\r\n\r\nThese themes allow effective response to customer needs and are consistent with the Division\u2019s operating strategy to maintain a highly synergistic research program that includes an appropriate balance of measurement, theory, and predictive models. The combination of the Division\u2019s world class expertise and unrivaled resources in measurement, archiving, and provision of high-quality property data is complemented by its forefront research to develop reliable and highly adaptable methods for estimating property data in cases where measurements are unavailable or extremely difficult and/or costly to obtain.\r\n\r\nCore Expertise\r\n\r\nThe expertise in the Division is broadly distributed within the fields of thermophysical properties and processes, emphasizing (1) data infrastructure and access; (2) predictive theory and models; and (3) experimental tools and measurements. More specifically, the Division maintains competence in data evaluation and dissemination; property models for industrial use; measurement of thermophysical properties; cryogenic technologies; separation technologies; fuel properties; and properties for environmental chemistry.\r\n\r\nKey Interactions with Customers\r\n\r\nDivision outputs are routinely used in a variety of industrial, governmental, and academic settings. For instance, through a collaboration with Aspen Technology, evaluated data from the NIST Thermodynamic Data Engine are available to some 60,000 chemical plants world-wide. A consortium of chemical and related companies provides direct input to the data collection and evaluation programs of the Thermodynamic Research Center Group. The NIST REFPROP database was purchased by some 1200 customers in 2008, and all cryogenic flow meters in the U.S. are tied to the Division\u2019s calibration and testing services. The Division houses the editorial offices of the International Journal of Thermophysics (and provides an editor of the Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data) and organizes the triennial Symposium on Thermophysical Properties to maintain connections.\r\n\r\nSponsored research in the Division also provides direct links to key customers: work with DOD (primarily the Air Force) is important to our fuels program; DHS funds some of our work on properties and data for explosives; DARPA works with the Division in its micro-cryocooler project; DOE is engaged in our properties work related to advanced power generation and in gas hydrates data.\r\n\r\nFuture Directions and Plans\r\n\r\nThe National challenges related to energy security and monitoring/mitigating anthropogenic climate (or other environmental) changes are reflected in the Division\u2019s plans. The Division recently held workshops on property needs for biofuels and aerospace fuels: alternative fuels and feedstocks will command an increased emphasis in the future.",

         "user" : "prophe",
         "description" : "Vietnam\u2019s first non-state university, Thang Long University, was founded in 1988 by a group of intellectuals. It had to wait for five years to be recognised as a successful pilot of a non-state higher education model. \r\n\r\nAfter this a series of legal frameworks were enacted to regulate three different types of non-state universities: those \u2018people-founded\u2019 institutions established by social and professional associations; private universities set up by corporates or individuals; and those which are semi-public \u2013 set up by the state but wholly financed by private income. \r\n\r\nHowever, because of the sensitivities in a communist country, no private university was allowed. The remaining two types of non-state university enjoyed more than a decade of stability and prosperity. \r\n\r\nAn uneasy introduction\r\n\r\nThe government officially legalised private universities in 2005. A few months later, the new version of the Education Law, passed by the National Assembly, recognised only two types of non-state universities, namely people-founded and private. The semi-public model was phased out. \r\n\r\nA year later, the prime minister allowed the first 19 people-founded universities to transfer to private status, with the remaining expected to follow suit. However, that transfer is still incomplete despite detailed guidance from the Ministry of Education and Training issued in 2014. \r\n\r\nOne reason for the delay is the significant differences in ownership between people-founded and private universities. The management board of people-founded universities consists not only of investors but also the university\u2019s founders, the rector, faculty representatives etc. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, investors are the sole owners of private universities, holding the highest decision-making authority. Hence, it was difficult to reach an internal consensus on the transfer of a people-founded university to private status. \r\n\r\nFor many of those that did reach a consensus, private university status brought more uncertainty than opportunities. Hung Vuong University started and completed its transfer in 2010. However, an internal dispute quickly arose and affected the Ministry of Education and Training. Both the chairman of the management board, a known businessman, and the rector were dismissed after revelations of wrongdoing by inspectors and student recruitment was suspended. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, after firing hundreds of staff and faculty the dying university had only a handful of staff and around 50 students left, but a huge debt of more than US$2 million. This was difficult to believe for a university founded by a noted doctor and professor, led by committed faculty and with over 10,000 students in its heyday before the transfer. \r\n\r\nHung Vuong shared the same fate as many first-generation people-founded universities. In the early 1990s, the private economy emerging from the Doi Moi (Innovation) policy in 1986 was still immature. Capitalists and investors with stable financial resources were almost non-existent. \r\n\r\nHence, initial investment in non-state universities came from hundreds of people, some of whom contributed non-monetary assets. In such cases, determining the value of non-monetary assets so contributors could be compensated, as was required during the transfer process, proved complicated. Once that obstacle had been overcome, another one lay in waiting. \r\n\r\nIn the mid-2000s, entrepreneurs and corporates who had prospered from the country\u2019s amazing economic growth started targeting private universities as super-profitable investments. With abundant financial resources, they quickly secured management positions in those universities and turned them into money-making machines. \r\n\r\nInside these universities were two opposing factions: committed faculty who prioritised education quality and investors whose ultimate goal was maximising profit. \r\n\r\nPrivate-public competition\r\n\r\nThis sort of turbulence was not the only thing private universities had to face. They have also been thrown into direct and fierce competition with public universities that are usually the first choice for high school graduates. \r\n\r\nIt is not the low, subsidised tuition fees that attract these students, but the quality of education offered and the chance to get a recognised graduate degree. However, public universities, constrained by state funding, must deal with the enrolment quota set by the ministry. This unintentionally means that private universities are able to recruit those students who fail to get into public universities.\r\n\r\nThe situation has changed significantly since 2014 when several top public universities were approved to pilot a financial autonomy scheme. This means they will no longer have to rely on state funding and are free to set their own student recruitment quotas. \r\n\r\nCurrently, 13 public universities, several of which are national elite universities, have piloted this scheme and Deputy Minister of Education and Training Professor Bui Van Ga has said the number of public universities applying for the scheme will not be capped. This policy puts private institutions in direct battle with public ones, a fight which private institutions are much less likely to win.\r\n\r\nNot-for-profit private higher education\r\n\r\n\u2018Not-for-profit\u2019 status emerged for the first time in the Higher Education Law of 2012. Two years later, not-for-profits were more clearly defined in the University Charter as universities where \u201Cshareholders receive dividends in proportion to their shareholding, although the dividend must be lower than state bond rates\u201D. \r\n\r\nThe legal emergence of \u2018not-for-profits\u2019 in 2012 brought problems that were equally severe as those which surfaced in the case of private status transfer. Internal conflicts arose immediately inside many private institutions that had been for profit. The not-for-profit model, often coupled with the kind of liberal education synonymous with the Ivy League, is appealing to educators. By contrast, investors in private universities saw the model as posing a serious threat to their investment.\r\n\r\nThese fierce internal conflicts turned Hoa Sen University, a high-performing private university that was highly valued by employers, upside down. The rector claimed that the university had been not-for-profit in its original design in the early 1990s. However, a group of shareholders held an extraordinary meeting and voted against her and the board chairman, who was also an intellectual inspired by the not-for-profit model. \r\n\r\nFor the two years following the introduction of the new policy, news of internal conflicts at the university hit the headlines and sparked heated debates among educators, policy-makers and society at large. The battle finally ended just before the close of 2016 when the government officially recognised the new management board which immediately dismissed the tenacious rector and re-directed the university back to the \u2018normal\u2019 path of private higher education, despite faculty and student protests.\r\n\r\nA gloomy outlook\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Vietnamese higher education system consisted of 428 institutions, 85 of which were private. Private universities enrolled almost 270,000 students, accounting for roughly 13% of total enrolment numbers. Compared with the target of 40% by 2020 set by the Higher Education Reform Agenda in 2005, the current percentage is too modest. Most doubt this goal can be achieved. \r\n\r\nPrivate higher education, whether for-profit or not, has proven to be a successful model in many countries. However, this does not seem to be the case in Vietnam, due to many factors, including political ones. \r\n\r\nThe battle between \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018for-profit' education and political sensitivities due to the country\u2019s communist background, combined with an inconsistent approach, have hampered the growth of private institutions. What is more, the number of students in private institutions has shown signs of stagnation. All of these factors collectively paint a gloomy picture for private higher education in Vietnam. ",

Livable City Nestled around two large harbors near the top of the North Island, Auckland is New Zealands economic powerhouse and home to almost a third of the South Pacific nations 4.5 million people. With a mild climate and abundance of parks and beaches, the so-called City of Sails routinely ranks among the worlds 10 most livable cities. Add to that a housing shortage and an historic lack of barriers to property speculation and the result: average house values in the city have jumped70 percentto NZ$1,079,473 ($711,000) in the past four years, according toCoreLogic. In comparison, house prices advanced only 9.9 percent to NZ$553,291 inthe capital, Wellington, and 50 percent to 443,399 pounds ($678,000) in London in the same period. Auckland house prices are now the second-highest relative to incomes among developed economies, prompting the central bank to flag the prospect on Nov. 11of adamaging correctionin the market that puts the New Zealand economy at risk. 'Landed Gentry' This boom that weve had has been huge, its just been extraordinary in terms of the scale of the price increases, saidShamubeel Eaqub, an independent economist in Auckland, who co-authoredGeneration Rent, a book on the decline of home ownership in New Zealand.

Since 2010, 21 in Auckland have sold for more than NZ$1 million, including a dozen in the past two financial years, according to the Housing New Zealand data obtained by Bloomberg. Quick Commute In a city where commuting by car is the norm, those in convenient locations and on larger-than-average blocks are especially prized, said Tony Tang, a property agent in central Auckland with real estate firm Ray White.

The 10 and 11 year-olds will also learn about the hazards they face in everyday life and what to do if an accident occurs. Seven different real-life scenarios that highlight potential dangers will be set up in the community fire station. Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service will be promoting bonfire and firework safety and discussing burns and scalds in an interactive and fun scenario. The children will also be shown video clips and photographs of real life incidents where children have been burned. They will learn about the consequences of such incidents and the impact they can have on themselves, the local environment and the fire and rescue service. Street pastors will be discussing with the children how anti-social behaviour impacts on their community and the benefits of having an ICE contact in their mobile phone. Other workshops will be delivered by the public health school nurses, Nexus, Northern Power Grid and the RNLI. At the end of each session, pupils will have the chance to ask questions and receive a Crucial Crew pack containing further resources, activities and information. The week-long event has been organised by the North Tyneside Child Accident Prevention (CAP) Strategy Group; a multi-agency task force and part of the Local Safeguarding Children Board. District Manager for North Tyneside Graeme Hurst, Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service, said: \"Sadly accidents are one of the biggest causes of fatalities amongst children and, by their very nature, can be prevented. We can't wrap children up in cotton wool, so its important they learn how to stay safe. By working with our partners we are able to highlight the various dangers, including fire, and promote ways of how they can stay safe.

This month scientists from over 60 nations on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the first part of their latest report on global warming.

(2) What are the costs of these actions and how do they relate to the costs of inaction? (3) How much time is available to realise the drastic reductions needed to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere? (4) What are the policy actions that can overcome the barriers to implementation? (5) How can climate mitigation policy be aligned with sustainable development policies?",

Biodiversity and poverty are also inextricably connected. For instance, changes to natural ecosystems influence both climate change and people\u2019s ability to cope with some of its damaging impacts. And in their turn climate change, as well as people\u2019s responses to it, affect biodiversity. Unpicking all these strands clearly shows that conserving and managing biodiversity can help natural systems and vulnerable people cope with a shifting global climate. Yet compared to activities such as forest conservation and afforestation \u201D\u201D widely noted as a way of sequestering carbon and cutting greenhouse gas emissions \u201D\u201D biodiversity conservation is a neglected area. That must change urgent support is needed for local solutions to biodiversity loss that provide benefits on all counts.

However, there has been increasing interest among legal scholars and moral and political philosophers in a human rights approach to climate change. This review focuses on the new literature in moral and political philosophy that has begun to explore the connections between human rights and climate change. The attractions of a human rights approach to climate change are explained. The idea of a moral conception of human rights is introduced and distinguished from human rights recognized in international and national law. The key features of moral human rights are identified and an important distinction between negative and positive rights is explained. The three main arguments in the literature connecting human rights and climate change are introduced and critical discussions of them are presented. The first argument (associated with Steve Vanderheiden) claims that there is a human right to a stable climate, which can be derived from a human right to an adequate environment. The second argument (associated with Simon Caney) claims that anthropogenic climate change violates basic human (negative) rights to life, health, and subsistence. The third argument claims that there is a human right to emit greenhouse gases. This argument has two versions. The first version claims that there is a human right to equal per capita emissions. The second version claims that there is a human right to subsistence emissions.

This is identified as a predictability problem with characteristics of both first kind and second kind (due to the slow components of the climate system). It is argued that, because of the non-linear and stochastic aspects of the climate system and of the anthropogenic and natural forcings, climate change contains an intrinsic level of uncertainty. As a result, climate change prediction needs to be approached in a probabilistic way. This requires a characterization and quantification of the uncertainties associated with the sequence of steps involved in a climate change prediction. A review is presented of different approaches recently proposed to produce probabilistic climate change predictions. The additional difficulties found when extending the prediction from the global to the regional scale and the implications that these have on the choice of prediction strategy are finally discussed.",

Regional temperature changes are often greater or smaller than corresponding changes in the global mean. In some cases the direction of change may also be different. For example, temperature changes are higher over land than over the ocean. Precipitation increases in some regions but decreases in others. Changes in extreme events may differ from changes in the corresponding mean. Present scientific knowledge clearly indicates that the already observed global trend towards warmer conditions will continue and that it will be accompanied by changes in yet other aspects of climate. This paper highlights, as a brief review, aspects of our changing climate from the available scientific knowledge with a bearing on the energy sector. Its focus is on temperature and precipitation, with some consideration of wind and sea level, among others. While uncertainties remain as far as the magnitude of future global-scale changes is concerned, and even more so their many regional patterns, significant changes are foreseen in, for example, global and regional temperature and precipitation, sea level rise, and in the characteristics of various extreme events.",

The CCC urges the Government to commit unilaterally to reducing emissions of all greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the UK by at least 34% in 2020 relative to 1990 levels (21% relative to 2005). This should be increased to 42% relative to 1990 (31% relative to 2005) once a global deal to reduce emissions is achieved. Meeting these targets is necessary to contain the threat of climate change. These significant reductions can be achieved without harming the UK's economy and at a cost less than 1% of GDP in 2020. In other words, an economy that might grow by 30% in the period to 2020, would instead grow by 29%. The CCC advises that this is a price worth paying, given the long-term costs of inaction on climate change.",

         "abstract": "Building a low-carbon economy, the first report by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) sets out the analysis underpinning the proposed level of the first three carbon budgets covering the periods 2008-12, 2013-17 and 2018-22. The CCC urges the Government to commit unilaterally to reducing emissions of all greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the UK by at least 34% in 2020 relative to 1990 levels (21% relative to 2005). This should be increased to 42% relative to 1990 (31% relative to 2005) once a global deal to reduce emissions is achieved. Meeting these targets is necessary to contain the threat of climate change. These significant reductions can be achieved without harming the UK's economy and at a cost less than 1% of GDP in 2020. In other words, an economy that might grow by 30% in the period to 2020, would instead grow by 29%. The CCC advises that this is a price worth paying, given the long-term costs of inaction on climate change.",

This paper is intended to review literature on climate\r\nchange vulnerability by exploring and synthesizing the various conceptual and analytical frameworks which is regarded to be\r\nimportant in the assessment of vulnerability to climate change. From the reviewed literature, several interpretation of the\r\nconcept of climate change vulnerability as well as theoretical frameworks are brought to the fore. The paper further\r\nhighlighted on the two well- known methodologies of estimating vulnerability in literature; the vulnerability variable\r\nassessment method and the indicator technique by espousing the merits and demerits of each approach. It is suggested that\r\nexploring integrated quantitative vulnerability assessment approach will enhance the understanding of climate change\r\nvulnerabilities.",

Researchers increasingly see migration as one of a range of potential means by which populations may adapt to the future impacts of climate change. Modelling of climate change-related migration is a relatively new undertaking. This article provides a brief overview of current scholarly understanding of climate change-related migration processes, identifies recent developments and current challenges in modelling, and suggests opportunities for enhancing future modelling efforts. Given the lack of reliable global datasets on environmentally related migration, regional and sub-regional modelling of climate change effects on migration is where most developments are likely to emerge in the short-run. Such models, which can draw on a range of GIS-based and statistical approaches, at present make use of fairly general assumptions about migration behavior, and therefore best serve as gauges of potential trends and migration hotspots, and not as absolute predictors of future migrant numbers. Models will become increasingly sophisticated as scholarly understanding of underlying factors influencing migration behavior, such as risk perception, social networks, and labor market connections, is improved. Obtaining reliable data for use in such models will remain a significant challenge in coming years. International policymakers seeking to expand the predictive capacity of models are encouraged to use existing mechanisms such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to develop protocols and mechanisms for collecting and sharing reliable data on climate-related population movements.",

Here, we show how changes in stratospheric circulation could play a significant role in future climate change in the extratropics through an additional shift in the tropospheric circulation. This shift in the circulation alters climate change in regional winter rainfall by an amount large enough to significantly alter regional climate change projections. The changes are consistent with changes in stratospheric winds inducing a change in the baroclinic eddy growth rate across the depth of the troposphere. A change in mean wind structure and an equatorward shift of the tropospheric storm tracks relative to models with poor stratospheric resolution allows coupling with surface climate. Using the Atlantic storm track as an example, we show how this can double the predicted increase in extreme winter rainfall over Western and Central Europe compared to other current climate projections.",

         "volume": "5","number": "5","pages": "208-215","abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing political, economic and environmental issues of our time. It demands honest and timely collective global actions. Despite the ever rising environmental catastrophes that are occurring around the world from destructive hurricanes, cyclones and flooding to sea level rise, coastal erosion, drought, fire, and sea acidification, there are climate change deniers who argue that climate change is not posing the kind of danger that is being put forward. Yet, if the global community does not take drastic measures now, climate change could result in many of the Pacific island nations being wiped from the map of the world in the not so distant future. The small island nations of the Pacific region are more vulnerable to the acute effects of climate change than any other region in the world. Most of these volcanic islands are barely a few metres above sea level. Ocean level rise amongst other climatic changes is threatening the very existence of these geographically isolated and small land masses. -ËThe rising scale and the intensity of storm surges, saltwater intrusion and coastal destruction of the past decades have decimated coping capacities, leaving island populations with failing crops, crippling water shortages and an uncertain future\u2019. The existential threat of environmental change is irrefutably claiming land and human lives year in and year out. It is now widely accepted by the scientific community that the Earth is undergoing drastic climate change due to increased greenhouse gas emissions1. Changes in global climate have occurred several times throughout the Earth\u2019s history but have stretched over very long periods of time whereas currently these changes are taking place over the space of a century or less1,2,3. This rapid change, associated with other threats resulting from human activity related to production and consumption4, are having a strong impact on biodiversity. Considered as one of the five main causes of species and populations losses, climate change may lead to direct alterations of natural habitats, forcing species to move from their historical range, adapt to new environmental conditions, find refuge in unaltered microhabitats or may lead to species extinction. Importantly, climate change acts in synergy with other human induced threats, such as land use intensification or biological invasion, increasing their effects.Most small islands already have high burdens of climate sensitive diseases such as vector , food and water borne diseases like malaria, dengue and diarrhoeal disease.The effects of climate change including increased average temperatures, more frequent and severe extreme weather events and rising sea levels will exacerbate this disease burden with an expected increase in illnesses and deaths, as well as threatening access to safe food supplies, clean water and sanitation Dr. Nasreen \"Impact of Climate Change on Island\" Published in International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development (ijtsrd), ISSN: 2456-6470, Volume-5 | Issue-5 , August 2021, URL: https://www.ijtsrd.com/papers/ijtsrd43817.pdf Paper URL: https://www.ijtsrd.com/other-scientific-research-area/enviormental-science/43817/impact-of-climate-change-on-island/dr-nasreen",

Consumption of estimated reserves of fossil fuels in the next two or three centuries will add far more CO2 to the atmosphere than has been emitted to date unless ambitious conservation efforts or technological innovations reduce the influx. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations will increase to levels at least twice and possibly four times the highest amounts measured in the last 800,000 years spanned by ice-core records. This warming will overwhelm natural variations in climate and cause climatic and environmental changes unprecedented in human experience. Atmospheric CO2 levels will eventually decrease as the ocean slowly absorbs much of the excess carbon, but this process will acidify the oceans. After the main pulse of fossil-fuel emissions has passed, atmosphericCO2 values will decrease back toward preindustrial levels, but enough CO2 willremain in the atmosphere to prevent future glaciations for tens of thousands of years.",

Here we explore the potential role of expanded wind energy deployment in climate change mitigation efforts. At present, most turbines are located in extra-tropical Asia, Europe and North America2, 3, where climate projections indicate continuity of the abundant wind resource during this century4, 5. Scenarios from international agencies indicate that this virtually carbon-free source could supply 10\u201331\\% of electricity worldwide by 2050 (refs 2, 6). Using these projections within Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate forcing scenarios7, we show that dependent on the precise RCP followed, pursuing a moderate wind energy deployment plan by 2050 delays crossing the 2 Â°C warming threshold by 1\u20136 years. Using more aggressive wind turbine deployment strategies delays 2 Â°C warming by 3\u201310 years, or in the case of RCP4.5 avoids passing this threshold altogether. To maximize these climate benefits, deployment of non-fossil electricity generation must be coupled with reduced energy use.",

The system\r\nexhibits natural variability on many scales of motion, in time as well as\r\nspace, and it is subject to various external forcings, natural as well as\r\nanthropogenic. This paper reviews the observational evidence on climate\r\nphenomena and the governing equations of planetary-scale flow, as well as\r\npresenting the key concept of a hierarchy of models as used in the climate\r\nsciences. Recent advances in the application of dynamical systems theory, on\r\nthe one hand, and of nonequilibrium statistical physics, on the other, are\r\nbrought together for the first time and shown to complement each other in\r\nhelping understand and predict the system's behavior. These complementary\r\npoints of view permit a self-consistent handling of subgrid-scale phenomena as\r\nstochastic processes, as well as a unified handling of natural climate\r\nvariability and forced climate change, along with a treatment of the crucial\r\nissues of climate sensitivity, response, and predictability.",

The wind power industry takes advantage of the country having some of the highest mean wind speeds in Europe. Future climate change, however, has the potential to alter the characteristics of the UK wind climate. Small changes in mean wind speed could produce much greater changes in wind energy output as the power generated is related to the cube of wind speed. This paper aims to use a simple method to provide insight into projected future UK wind climate and how this might differ from current patterns. A discussion of the scale of the projected impacts on the wind energy industry follows.",

Based on the observational analysis, the climate change has significant effects, both positive and negative, in every field within the study area, and with the harmful effects far more prevalent. Under the scenario A1B, it is reported that temperature, precipitation, days of heat waves and extreme precipitation intensity will increase at respective rates of 0.38Â°C per decade, 12.6 mm per decade, 6.4 d and 47 mm per decade in the 21st century. It is widely believed that these climate changes in the future will result in some apparent impacts on agro-ecosystems, water resources, wetland ecosystem, forest ecosystem, human health, energy sectors and other sensitive fields in Central China. Due to the limited scientific knowledge and researches, there are still some shortages in the climate change assessment methodologies and many uncertainties in the climate prediction results. Therefore, it is urgent and essential to increase the studies of the regional climate change adaptation, extend the research fields, and enhance the studies in the extreme weather and climate events to reduce the uncertainties of the climate change assessments.

Uncertainty is often quantified when projecting future greenhouse gas emissions and their influence on climate2. However, multi-model uncertainty analysis of crop responses to climate change is rare because systematic and objective comparisons among process-based crop simulation models1, 3 are difficult4. Here we present the largest standardized model intercomparison for climate change impacts so far. We found that individual crop models are able to simulate measured wheat grain yields accurately under a range of environments, particularly if the input information is sufficient. However, simulated climate change impacts vary across models owing to differences in model structures and parameter values. A greater proportion of the uncertainty in climate change impact projections was due to variations among crop models than to variations among downscaled general circulation models. Uncertainties in simulated impacts increased with CO2 concentrations and associated warming. These impact uncertainties can be reduced by improving temperature and CO2 relationships in models and better quantified through use of multi-model ensembles. Less uncertainty in describing how climate change may affect agricultural productivity will aid adaptation strategy development andpolicymaking",

From this perspective, individuals who have direct experience of phenomena that may be linked to climate change would be more likely to be concerned by the issue and thus more inclined to undertake sustainable behaviours. So far, the evidence available to test this hypothesis is limited, and in part contradictory. Here we use national survey data collected from 1,822 individuals across the UK in 2010, to examine the links between direct flooding experience, perceptions of climate change and preparedness to reduce energy use. We show that those who report experience of flooding express more concern over climate change, see it as less uncertain and feel more confident that their actions will have an effect on climate change. Importantly, these perceptual differences also translate into a greater willingness to save energy to mitigate climate change. Highlighting links between local weather events and climate change is therefore likely to be a useful strategy for increasing concern and action.",

We argue that the key justice dilemmas of adaptation include responsibility for climate change impacts, the level and burden sharing of assistance to vulnerable countries for adaptation, distribution of assistance between recipient countries and adaptation measures, and fair participation in planning and making decisions on adaptation. We demonstrate how the climate change regime largely omits responsibility but makes a general commitment to assistance. However, the regime has so far failed to operationalise assistance and has made only minor progress towards eliminating obstacles for fair participation. We propose the adoption of four principles for fair adaptation in the climate change regime. These include avoiding dangerous climate change, forward-looking responsibility, putting the most vulnerable first and equal participation of all. We argue that a safe maximum standard of 400\u2013500 ppm of \\CO2\\ concentrations in the atmosphere and a carbon tax of $20\u201350 per carbon equivalent ton could provide the initial instruments for operationalising the principles.",

Complementing the text is a series of aerial photographs and videos, all shot over the past year by George Steinmetz. With support from the Pulitzer Center, this two-part article is based on 18 months of reporting and well over a hundred interviews. It tracks the efforts of a small group of American scientists, activists and politicians to raise the alarm and stave off catastrophe. It will come as a revelation to many readers \u2014 an agonizing revelation \u2014 to understand how thoroughly they grasped the problem and how close they came to solving it. Jake Silverstein",

This is likely to lead to misrepresentation of impacts, and consequently to poor decisions about climate adaptation. However, no published research assesses the differences between impacts simulated by single-sector and integrated models. Here we compare 14 indicators derived from a set of impact models run within single-sector and integrated frameworks across a range of climate and socio-economic scenarios in Europe. We show that single-sector studies misrepresent the spatial pattern, direction and magnitude of most impacts because they omit the complex interdependencies within human and environmental systems. The discrepancies are particularly pronounced for indicators such as food production and water exploitation, which are highly influenced by other sectors through changes in demand, land suitability and resource competition. Furthermore, the discrepancies are greater under different socio-economic scenarios than different climate scenarios, and at the sub-regional rather than Europe-wide scale.",

A key aspect of this requirement is the representation of uncertainties. The conventional approach to representing uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change is probabilistic, based on ensembles of climate model simulations. In the face of deep uncertainties, the known limitations of this approach are becoming increasingly apparent. An alternative is thus emerging which may be called a `storyline' approach. We define a storyline as a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways. No a priori probability of the storyline is assessed; emphasis is placed instead on understanding the driving factors involved, and the plausibility of those factors. We introduce a typology of four reasons for using storylines to represent uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change: (i) improving risk awareness by framing risk in an event-oriented rather than a probabilistic manner, which corresponds more directly to how people perceive and respond to risk; (ii) strengthening decision-making by allowing one to work backward from a particular vulnerability or decision point, combining climate change information with other relevant factors to address compound risk and develop appropriate stress tests; (iii) providing a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty, thereby allowing the use of more credible regional models in a conditioned manner and (iv) exploring the boundaries of plausibility, thereby guarding against false precision and surprise. Storylines also offer a powerful way of linking physical with human aspects of climate change.",

The COP23, hosted by threated Pacifc Island Fiji, must come up with the means and tools of decarbonisation, as CO2emissions must be reduced. Solar power parks will do, if backed globally.

In the time since the paper appeared, there has been increased interest in assessing how weather extremes may be altered by climate change. Much of the work has been conducted using extreme value analysis, which is the branch of statistics developed specifically to characterize extreme events. This commentary discusses the advantages of an EVA approach and reviews some EVA techniques that have been used to describe climate change\u2019s potential impact on extreme phenomena. Additionally, this commentary illustrates basic EVA techniques in an analysis of temperatures for central England. In parallel to Wigley\u2019s analysis, a time-varying EVA analysis is compared to a stationary one, and furthermore, the trend from the EVA analysis is compared to the trend in means.",

The analysis uses the new version of the GTAP-W model, which distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture and implements water as an explicit factor of production for irrigated agriculture. Future climate change is likely to modify regional water endowments and soil moisture. As a consequence, the distribution of harvested land will change, modifying production and international trade patterns. The results suggest that a partial analysis of the main factors through which climate change will affect agricultural productivity provide a false appreciation of the nature of changes likely to occur. Our results show that global food production, welfare and GDP fall in the two time periods and SRES scenarios. Higher food prices are expected. No matter which SRES scenario is preferred, we find that the expected losses in welfare are significant. These losses are slightly larger under the SRES A2 scenario for the 2020s and under the SRES A1B scenario for the 2050s. The results show that national welfare is influenced both by regional climate change and climate-induced changes in competitiveness.",

         "volume": "6","number": "3","pages": "1532-1538","abstract": "Natural resource scarcity and global climate change may alter the risk of violent conflict in the future. Resource scarcity to meet basic needs such as food and land and water can be worsened by governmental ineffectiveness, and vulnerability of populations, ecosystems, economies, and institutions can outweigh the magnitude of climate or scarcity impacts themselves. Resource availability must be seen not as a stand alone issue, but rather in the context of the overall political economy landscape. Policymakers can benefit from the use of surveillance, early warning systems, and risk anticipation to plan for coming natural disasters and associated scarcity. Development of resilience can offer valuable adaptation and risk reduction methodologies while international action needs to focus on improving cooperation and resilience of international markets through multilateral trade rules or stockpiling of key commodities. Too often, the natural environment is directly attacked or damaged by warfare. Attacks can lead to water, soil and land contamination, or release pollutants into the air. Explosive remnants of war can contaminate soil and water sources, and harm wildlife. Such environmental degradation reduces peoples resilience and ability to adapt to climate change. The indirect effects of conflict can also result in further environmental degradation, for example authorities are less able to manage and protect the environment large scale displacement places strain on resources natural resources can be exploited to sustain war economies. In Fao, south of Basra, Iraq, people blame their water and farming problems on the felling of date palms for military purposes during the Iran Iraq war. Conflict can also contribute to climate change. For example, the destruction of large areas of forest, or damage to infrastructure such as oil installations or big industrial facilities, can have detrimental climate consequences, including the release of large volumes of greenhouse gases into the air.

The main sources of climate change information consulted by newspaper journalists in Tanzania are climate change experts and daily events, such as community meetings and other relevant social gatherings. These sources are interactive -- enabling journalists to obtain climate change information -- and easily accessible, and use and provide instant responses. It was also found that deficient use of other potential sources of information, such as libraries, printed materials and Internet websites, coupled with overarching challenges that limit newspaper journalists from seeking, covering and reporting information on climate change, may affect the quality and quantity of climate change information published in Tanzanian newspapers. All the stakeholders involved in the fight against climate change and journalism colleges should collaborate and devise strategies aimed at building the capacity of newspaper journalists, editors and reporters in their daily activities.",

         "volume": "34","abstract": "Solar activity has been observed to vary on decadal and centennial time scales. Recent evidence (Bond, 2002) points to a major semi-periodic variation of approximately 1,500 yrs. For this reason, and because high resolution proxy records are limited to the past thousand years or so, assessing the role of the sun's variability on climate change over this time f ame has received much attention. A pressingr application of these assessments is the attempt to separate the role of the sun from that of various anthropogenic forcings in the past century and a half. This separation is complicated by the possible existence of natural variability other than solar, and by the fact that the time-dependence of solar and anthropogenic forcings is very similar over the past hundred years or so. It has been generally assumed that solar forcing is direct, i.e. changes in sun's irradiance. However, evidence has been put forth suggesting that there exist various additional indirect forcings that could be as large as or even exceed direct forcing (modulation of cosmic ray - induced cloudiness, UV- induced stratospheric ozone change s, or oscillator -driven changes in the Pacific Ocean). Were such forcings to be large, they could account for nearly all 20th Century warming, relegating anthropogenic effects to a minor role. Determination of climate change over the last thousand years offers perhaps the best way to assess the magnitude of total solar forcing, thus allowing its comparison with that of anthropogenic sources. Perhaps the best proxy records for climate variation in the past 1,000 yrs have been variations in temperat ure sensitive tree rings (Briffa and Osborne, 2002). A paucity of such records in the Southern Hemisphere has largely limited climate change determinations to the subtropical NH. Two problems with tree rings are that the rings respond to temperature differently with the age of the tree, and record largely the warm, growing season only. It appears that both these problems have been adequately solved although caution is warranted. A promising adjunct to tree rings is actual measurement of temperatures in boreholes. Inversion of such records gives low frequency temperatures that are potentially more accurate than any proxy- derived ones. All these records give a fairly consistent picture of at least one major warming and cooling extreme (Medieval Warming Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA). Many modeling efforts using direct solar forcing have been done. These typically employ proxy data (sunspot number and variations in Be-10 and C -14 calibrated by satellite observations) for changes in solar forcing, and give the same general picture-- that of a substantial warming 1,000 yrs ago (MWP) followed by cooling that was particularly marked in the late 17th and early 19th centuries (LIA). The resulting amplitude of temperature change between MWP and LIA agrees well with paleo-temperature reconstructions and suggests that solar forcing alone is inadequate to account for more than about half the 20th century warming (Lean et al 1995, Crowley and Lowry 2000). Since these quantitatively reproduce climate variations in the past 1000 years, the role of indirect solar forcing is inferred to be small but may be important (Lean and Rind 2001).

In a cross-validation framework based on a RCM control simulation over Europe, QM reduces the bias of daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature, precipitation amount, and derived indices of extremes by about one order of magnitude and strongly improves the shapes of the related frequency distributions. In addition, a simple extrapolation of the error correction function enables QM to reproduce \u201Cnew extremes\u201D without deterioration and mostly with improvement of the original RCM quality. QM only moderately modifies the CCS of the corrected parameters. The changes are related to trends in the scenarios and magnitude-dependent error characteristics.

The POLES global energy model has been modified to widen the coverage of climate change impacts on the European energy system. The impacts considered are changes in heating and cooling demand in the residential and services sector, changes in the efficiency of thermal power plants, and changes in hydro, wind (both on- and off-shore) and solar PV electricity output. Results of the impacts of six scenarios on the European energy system are presented, and the implications for European energy security and energy imports are presented.\n\nMain findings include: demand side impacts (heating and cooling in the residential and services sector) are larger than supply side impacts; power generation from fossil-fuel and nuclear sources decreases and renewable energy increases; and impacts are larger in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe.\n\nThere remain many more climate change impacts on the energy sector that cannot currently be captured due to a variety of issues including: lack of climate data, difficulties translating climate data into energy-system-relevant data, lack of detail in energy system models where climate impacts act. This paper does not attempt to provide an exhaustive analysis of climate change impacts in the energy sector, it is rather another step towards an increasing coverage of possible impacts.",

The 1.5Â Â°C limit constitutes an ambitious goal for which greater evidence on its benefits for health would help guide policy and potentially increase the motivation for action. Here we contribute to this gap with an assessment on the potential health benefits, in terms of reductions in temperature-related mortality, derived from the compliance to the agreed temperature targets, compared to more extreme warming scenarios. We performed a multi-region analysis in 451 locations in 23 countries with different climate zones, and evaluated changes in heat and cold-related mortality under scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets (1.5 and 2Â Â°C) and more extreme GMT increases (3 and 4Â Â°C), and under the assumption of no changes in demographic distribution and vulnerability. Our results suggest that limiting warming below 2Â Â°C could prevent large increases in temperature-related mortality in most regions worldwide. The comparison between 1.5 and 2Â Â°C is more complex and characterized by higher uncertainty, with geographical differences that indicate potential benefits limited to areas located in warmer climates, where direct climate change impacts will be more discernible.",

In a context of fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within Â±15 and Â±20Â \\% by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will not exceed 5 and 15Â \\% in magnitude at the European and national scale respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.",

It offers a careful discussion of the values that support these projects and a critical evaluation of the normative bases of climate change policy. This book regards climate change policy as a public problem that normative philosophy can shed light on. It assumes that the development of policy should be based on values regarding what is important to respect, preserve, and protect. What sort of climate change policy do we owe the poor of the world who are particularly vulnerable to climate change? Why should our generation take on the burden of mitigating climate change that is caused, in no small part, by emissions from people now dead? What value is lost when natural species go extinct, as they may well do en masse because of climate change? This book presents a broad and inclusive discussion of climate change policy, relevant to those with interests in public policy, development studies, environmental studies, political theory, and moral and political philosophy.",

There was a significant increasing trend in annual mean temperature for Central China during 1961\u20132010. The increasing rate was 0.15Â°C per decade, which was lower than the national trend. Since the mid-1980s, temperature increasing was obvious. Large increasing rate was observed in the mid-eastern part of Central China. For the four seasons, the increasing rate in winter was the largest (0.27Â°C per decade). The increasing rate in the annual mean minimum temperature was larger than that in the annual mean maximum temperature from 1961 to 2010. As a result, the diurnal range of temperature decreased at the rate of \u20130.10Â°C per decade. The extreme high temperature events were increasing while the extreme low temperature events were significantly decreasing. There was no obvious trend in annual precipitation for Central China during 1961\u20132010. Precipitation in summer and winter significantly increased; change of precipitation in spring was not obvious; precipitation in autumn was decreasing. The decreasing rate of annual rainy days was \u20133.4 d per decade. The precipitation intensity increased at the rate of 0.25 mm d\u20131Â per decade. Heavy-rain days significantly increased. Spring and summer started earlier while autumn and winter started later. As a result, spring and summer duration was expanding whereas autumn and winter duration shortened. Wan, S.-Q., Y. Gao, B.

As evidence of the anthropogenic influence on the Earth\u2019s climate has grown over the past few decades, climate change has come to be viewed as a primary challenge to be confronted in the twenty-first century. Geoengineering, or climate engineering, is a set of large-scale technological interventions proposed to offset climatic changes. This study seeks to understand which factors contribute to, or alternatively, detract from public acceptance of geoengineering through robust path analytic modeling of public perceptions of geoengineering that may better serve the academic community and decision-makers. This study finds that familiarity, epistemic trust, preference for alternative solutions to climate change, and media consumption are interrelated in their influences on opinions toward geoengineering proposals and support for funding further geoengineering research. Such predictive modeling can enable risk communicators and policy-makers with vital information to support anticipatory governance approaches to policy initiatives and improve future public engagement and communication about geoengineering.",

The broad scope of climate change impacts means that successful adaptation and mitigation efforts will require an unprecedented collaboration effort that unites diverse disciplines and is able to rapidly respond to evolving climate issues (IPCC, 2014). However, to achieve this aim, climate change research practices need updating: key research findings remain behind journal paywalls, and scientific progress can be impeded by low levels of reproducibility and transparency (Ellison, 2010; Morueta-Holme et al., 2018), individual data ownership (Hampton et al., 2015), and inefficient research workflows (Lowndes et al., 2017). Furthermore, the level of public interest and policy engagement on climate change issues relies on fast communication of academic research to public institutions, with the result that the societal impact of climate change studies will differ according to their public availability and exposure. Here, we argue that by adopting open science (OS) principles, scientists can advance climate change research and accelerate efforts to mitigate impacts; especially for highly vulnerable developing regions of the world where research capacity is limited. We underscore the specific benefits of OS in raising the academic and societal impact of climate change research using citation and media metrics.",

Much of this literature has been produced outside of the academy by scholars and practitioners working in  \u201D think tanks,\u201D government agencies, and international/multilateral institutions. Here we reviewed a selected set of 58 articles and reports primarily from such sources and performed textual analysis of the arguments. Our review of this literature identifies three potential mechanisms for linking climate change and energy security: Climate change may 1) create second-order effects that may exacerbate social instability and disrupt energy systems; 2) directly impact energy supply and/or systems or 3) influence energy security through the effects of climate-related policies. We identify emerging risks to energy security driven by climate mitigation technology choices but find less evidence of climate change's direct physical impacts. We used both empirical and qualitative selection factors for choosing the grey literature sample. The sources we selected were published in the last 5Â years, available through electronic media and were written in language accessible to general policy or academic readers. The organizations that published the literature had performed previous research in the general fields of energy and/or climate change with some analytical content and identified themselves as non-partisan. This literature is particularly valuable to scholars because identifies understudied relationships that can be rigorously assessed through academic tools and methodologies and informs a translational research agenda that will allow scholars to engage with practitioners to address challenges that lie at the nexus of climate change and energy security.",

We map global variation in terrestrial wind regimes, and model how \u2018windscape\u2019 connectivity will shape inbound and outbound dispersal between sites and their predicted future climate analogs. This model predicts that wind-accessible, climatically analogous sites will be scarcer in locations such as the tropics and on the leeward sides of mountain ranges, implying that the wind-dispersed biota in these landscapes may be more vulnerable to future climate change. A case study of Pinus contorta illustrates species-specific patterns of predicted genetic rescue and range expansion facilitated by wind. This framework has implications across fields ranging from historical biogeography and landscape genetics to ecological forecasting and conservation planning.",

Initially, the methods of scenario construction are described. These involve the scaling of the regional patterns of equilibrium climate change produced by general circulation models (GCMs) by the time-dependent projection of global-mean temperature change. A 'Business-as-Usual' forcing scenario is then used to project global warming to the year 2050. This projection is used to develop scenarios of the UK temperature and precipitation change. The implications for sea level are also discussed. Finally, the climate change 'commitment' for the UK, due to past radiative forcing changes and the lags in the climate system, is considered.",

The Mediterranean and North Eastern European regions emerge as the primary Hot-Spots, followed by high latitude northern hemisphere regions and by Central America, the most prominent tropical Hot-Spot. The main African Hot-Spots are Southern Equatorial Africa and the Sahara. Eastern North America is the prominent Hot-Spot over the continental U. S.

However, social science research suggests a complex relationship between religious concepts and environmental attitudes, raising the question of what influence the pope's position may have on public opinion regarding this polarizing issue. In a national probability survey experiment of U.S. adults (n\u2009=\u20091212), we find that brief exposure to Pope Francis influenced the climate-related beliefs of broad segments of the public: it increased perceptions of climate change as a moral issue for the overall sample (and among Republicans in particular) and increased felt personal responsibility for contributing to climate change and its mitigation (among Democrats). Moreover, prior awareness of the pope's views on climate change mattered, such that those who indicated greater awareness of the pope's position showed stronger treatment effects, consistent with a priming account of these effects. Results complement recent correlational findings and offer further evidence of the Vatican's influence on climate change public opinion.",

Their vulnerability to climate change comes both from being predominantly located in the tropics, and from various socioeconomic, demographic, and policy trends limiting their capacity to adapt to change. However, these impacts will be difficult to model or predict because of (i) the lack of standardised definitions of these sorts of farming system, and therefore of standard data above the national level, (ii) intrinsic characteristics of these systems, particularly their complexity, their location-specificity, and their integration of agricultural and nonagricultural livelihood strategies, and (iii) their vulnerability to a range of climate-related and other stressors. Some recent work relevant to these farming systems is reviewed, a conceptual framework for understanding the diverse forms of impacts in an integrated manner is proposed, and future research needs are identified.",

         "abstract": "Fire is an important component of the Earth system, affecting the land surface, releasing gases to the atmosphere, and altering the water cycle. Yet many Earth System Models lack full representation of this process, giving rise to uncertainty about its contribution to the development and stability of ecosystems now and in the future. In this PhD I investigate the impact of fire on the land surface today, and how this might change with drought events and with climate change in the future by developing the land surface model JULES to represent fire-vegetation interactions for the first time. I introduce a new fire disturbance term based on burnt area from the INFERNO fire model, and analyse the results of the coupling, together with changes in land-use, against observations of present day vegetation cover. I find that the simulation of vegetation cover is improved when disturbance is included, and that fire is important in the development of savanna regions. I apply the new modelling capability to assess the impact of the 2015/16 El NiÃ±o event on fire, where projections show that burned area and fire emissions were higher due to the El NiÃ±o. The largest impact was across South America, where carbon uptake was reduced due to increases in fire, inducing a shift from a net sink of carbon to a net source. Fire danger may be further exacerbated in years of higher temperatures and drought in the future as a result of climate change. I apply the capability to model different aspects of the fire regime with future scenarios of climate and land-use change across a range of emission scenarios. Using Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios, I show that burned area is projected to increase in the future, with hotter, drier conditions increasing with higher emission scenarios and greater changes in land-use, especially across South America but not homogeneously. Using a theoretical scenario of Solar Radiation Management to limit temperature rise to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial, I show that meteorological fire danger is generally reduced compared to 2.0Â°C, although there are regional variations and some regions show an increase including USA and Asia. This work furthers our current modelling capability around fire vegetation interactions, and enhances our understanding of the response of ecosystems to changes in fire, climate and land-use., European Commission",

         "volume": "12","number": "5","pages": "892-902","abstract": "Climate has been changing in the last fifty years in China and will continue to change regardless any efforts for mitigation. Agriculture is a climate-dependent activity and highly sensitive to climate changes and climate variability. Understanding the interactions between climate change and agricultural production is essential for society stable development of China. The first mission is to fully understand how to predict future climate and link it with agriculture production system. In this paper, recent studies both domestic and international are reviewed in order to provide an overall image of the progress in climate change researches. The methods for climate change scenarios construction are introduced. The pivotal techniques linking crop model and climate models are systematically assessed and climate change impacts on Chinese crops yield among model results are summarized. The study found that simulated productions of grain crop inherit uncertainty from using different climate models, emission scenarios and the crops simulation models. Moreover, studies have different spatial resolutions, and methods for general circulation model (GCM) downscaling which increase the uncertainty for regional impacts assessment. However, the magnitude of change in crop production due to climate change (at 700 ppm CO2 eq correct) appears within Â±10% for China in these assessments. In most literatures, the three cereal crop yields showed decline under climate change scenarios and only wheat in some region showed increase. Finally, the paper points out several gaps in current researches which need more studies to shorten the distance for objective recognizing the impacts of climate change on crops. The uncertainty for crop yield projection is associated with climate change scenarios, CO2 fertilization effects and adaptation options. Therefore, more studies on the fields such as free air CO2 enrichment experiment and practical adaptations implemented need to be carried out.",

So far, the statistical theory of extreme values has been primarily applied to climate under the assumption of stationarity. How this theory can be applied in the context of climate change, including implications for the analysis of the economic impacts of extremes, is described. Future research challenges include the statistical modeling of complex extreme events, such as heat waves, and taking into account spatial dependence in the statistical modeling of extremes for fields of climate observations or of numerical model output. Addressing these challenges will require increased collaboration between climate scientists and statisticians.",

The Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite allows for the first time estimates of Unconditional, Convective and Stratiform rain rates in West Africa. The 1998 estimated TRMM rates are compared to long-term observed rain rates and a merged rain data set (CMAP) during 1998. Further, the TRMM estimates are compared to the simulated rain rates from the Community Climate Model Version 3.6. The TRMM Precipitation Radar rain estimates are generally lower than either the long-term observations or the CMAP rates during 1998. Moreover, the TRMM rain estimates show a significant fraction of the total rain (convective + stratiform) is characterized as stratiform rain (30\u201340\\%). The CCM3 simulates primarily convective rain and negligible amounts of non-convective rain for West Africa. Furthermore, the TRMM high-resolution rain patterns strongly imply that rain in West Africa occurs on mesoscales in association with mesoscale convective systems (squall lines, mesoscale convective complexes and non-squall tropical clusters). We demonstrate this by briefly examining two mesoscale convective systems during May 1998 with METEOSAT data. Regional climate models may offer the best solution to understanding climate change in West Africa because of their ability to capture mesoscale systems and better their representation of orographic features. Adequate boundary conditions from Global Climate Models are still necessary for regional climate model simulations to successfully reproduce mean climate conditions and provide understanding with respect to future climate change. Observations in West Africa should be maintained or increased for monitoring climate variability and possibility of climate change in West Africa, proper initialization of numerical weather prediction models and the validation of climate models.",

The ecological diversities that occur over a period of time vary with the effect on its subsidiaries and thereby cause an overall change in its surroundings. The main focus of the work is to relate climate change model considered as in the form of a mathematical expression and also study its effects onto the elements of nature that are eventually affected during a particular event. These parameters are developed in the form of a function which further manifests according to the types of events that are resulting out of it. The current paper works on to facilitate an attempt to form a mathematical model to relate such climatic changes and the parameters affecting it and also relate it to the previously existing similar model. There are further influences of the cesaro summation and later convolutes with the Fejer kernel that links the Fourier condition to manifest the efficiency of this model. Major factors that we focus are the heat change, atmospheric pressure and the humidity change that form the major components of the Fourier series when treated with the Fejer kernel once they are declared under the Cesaro conditions of summation.

In doing so, they evoke climate change in particular ways, and make the issue meaningful in everyday discourse. While a diversity of climate change imagery exists, particular types of climate imagery appear to have gained dominance, promoting particular ways of knowing about climate change (and marginalizing others). This imagery, and public engagement with this imagery, helps to shape the cultural politics of climate change in important ways. This article critically reviews the nascent research area of the visual representations of climate change, and public engagement with visual imagery. It synthesizes a diverse body of research to explore visual representations and engagement across the news media, NGO communications, advertising, and marketing, climate science, art, and virtual reality systems. The discussion brings together three themes which occur throughout the review: time, truth, and power. The article concludes by suggesting fruitful directions for future research in the visual communication of climate change.

         "abstract": "The complex nature of the energy industry across extraction, transportation, processing, delivery and decommissioning creates significant challenges to how the sector responds, adapts and mitigates against risks posed by the changing future climate. Any disruption in this interconnected system will affect both industry and society. For example, in the summer of 2005 Hurricane Katrina and a month later Hurricane Rita had wide reaching impacts on the US offshore Oil and Gas industry which resulted in an increase in global oil prices due to loss of production and refinery shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nPreparing, mitigating and adapting to these climate changes is dependent upon identifying appropriate climate indicators as well as the associated critical operational thresholds and design criteria of the identified vulnerable assets. The characterization and understanding of the likely changes in these climate indicators will form the basis for adaptation plans and mitigating actions.\r\n\r\nThe Met Office in collaboration with energy industry partners, under the Copernicus Clim4energy European project, has developed a Climate Change Risk Assessment tool, which allows the visualization and extraction of the most recent sea level and wave climate information to evaluate their future changes. This study illustrates the application of this tool for evaluation of the potential vulnerability of an offshore infrastructure in the North Sea.\r\n\r\nThe analysis shows that for this asset there is a small increase in sea level of 0.20\u20130.30 m at the location of interest by 2050. However, there is a small decrease or no consistent changes projected in the future wave climate. This wave signal is small compared to the uncertainty of the wave projections and the associated inter-annual variability. Therefore, for the 2050s time horizon, at the location of interest, there is no strong impact of climate change at the annual scale on the significant wave height, the sea level and thus the associated climate change driven extreme water level. However, further analysis are required at the seasonal and monthly scales.",

         "description" : "Changes in extreme temperatures and precipitation are examined in three 3-member ensembles of transient climate change simulations performed with the second-generation coupled global climate model of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis. The ensembles cover the time period 1990\u20132100 and use the IPCC IS92a, A2, and B2 emission scenarios. The first two scenarios employ similar radiative forcings, while the B2 scenario produces less future warming. Extreme events are described in terms of return val- ues of annual extremes, that is, the thresholds that are exceeded by annual extremes in any given year with probability 1/T, where T is the return period in years. The return values are estimated from a GEV distribu- tion with time-dependent parameters fitted to annual extremes obtained from 51-yr moving windows. Each sample of annual extremes contains 153 (3 Ï« 51) values. The GEV distribution was fitted by the method of maximum likelihood. To summarize: \u2022 The ML method for fitting a GEV distribution with time-dependent parameters appears to be a more ap- propriate choice for transient climate change simula- tions than the method of L moments. The latter may produce biased return value estimates for the climate change rates that are typical in the considered simu- lations by the end of the twenty-first century, particu- larly for temperature extremes. The biases become larger with larger sampling windows and are the con- sequence of the violation of the stationarity assump- tion implicit in the L-moments method. The biases in L-moment return values obtained for 21-yr sampling windows are not very large in absolute terms so that the conclusions in KZ2000 based on the L-moment method are not seriously affected by this finding. However, the biases may be substantial when ex- pressed in terms of the corresponding return periods. Globally averaged changes in temperature extremes are primarily associated with changes in the location of the extreme value distribution of annual extremes. There are no substantial changes in the shape of the distribution in most locations. Exceptions from this general rule occur in regions where land and ocean surface properties undergo drastic changes under global warming such as the regions of sea ice and snow cover retreat. In particular, the interannual variability of annual cold extremes (and therefore the scale parameter of the corresponding GEV distribu- tion) is greatly reduced in sea ice and snow-covered areas that become generally ice and snow free in the warmer climate. Changes in cold extremes in these areas are much greater than changes in the annual mean daily minimum temperature. Wintertime warming in these regions is amplified by the surface albedo feedback. On the other hand, the variability of annual cold extremes is increased in areas adjacent to the sea ice and snow cover lines in the warmer world because these areas are snow covered in some years and snow free in other years. The variability of annual warm extremes (and the corresponding scale parameter) increases over land areas where reductions in soil moisture reduce the moderating effect due to evaporative cooling. Con- sequently, these regions experience greater changes in warm extremes as compared to changes in the an- nual temperature mean. Conversely, changes in warm extremes in the polar land areas are smaller than changes in the annual mean of daily maximum temperature. This is because the greatest tempera- ture changes in these areas occur in winter as a result of extensive melting of sea ice in the adjacent oceans, while warm temperature extremes tend to occur in summer. Changes in precipitation extremes are associated with changes in both the location and scale of the distribution. The distribution of annual extremes shifts to the right and becomes wider under global warming. Changes in the extreme daily precipitation rate are substantially larger than the changes in the annual mean precipitation rate. The latter is reduced in some parts of the world while extreme precipita- tion increases almost everywhere. The probability of precipitation events that are considered extreme in the year 2000 is increased by a factor about of 2 by the end of the twenty-first century in the considered transient climate change simulations.",

Three-member ensembles were produced for the time period 1990-2100 using the IS92a, A2, and B2 emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The return values of annual extremes are estimated from a fitted generalized extreme value distribution with time-dependent location and scale parameters by the method of maximum likelihood. The L-moment return value estimates are revisited and found to be somewhat biased in the context of transient climate change simulations. The climate response is of similar magnitude in the integrations with the IS92a and A2 emission scenarios but more modest for the B2 scenario. Changes in temperature extremes are largely associated with changes in the location of the distribution of annual extremes without substantial changes in its shape over most of the globe. Exceptions are regions where land and ocean surface properties change drastically, such as the regions that experience sea ice and snow cover retreat. Globally averaged changes in warm extremes are comparable to the corresponding changes in annual mean daily maximum temperature, while globally averaged cold extremes warm up faster than annual mean daily minimum temperature. There are considerable regional differences between the magnitudes of changes in temperature extremes and the corresponding annual means. Changes in precipitation extremes are due to changes in both the location and scale of the extreme value distribution and exceed substantially the corresponding changes in the annual mean precipitation. Generally speaking, the warmer model climate becomes wetter and hydrologically more variable. The probability of precipitation events that are considered extreme at the beginning of the simulations is increased by a factor of about 2 by the end of the twenty-first century.",

Hourly concentrations were estimated for 50 eastern US cities for five representative summers each in the 1990s and 2050s, reflecting current and projected future climates, respectively. Estimates of future concentrations were based on the IPCC A2 scenario using global climate, regional climate, and regional air quality models. This work does not explore the effects of future changes in anthropogenic emissions, but isolates the impact of altered climate on ozone and health. The cities\u2019 ozone levels are estimated to increase under predicted future climatic conditions, with the largest increases in cities with present-day high pollution. On average across the 50 cities, the summertime daily 1-h maximum increased 4.8 ppb, with the largest increase at 9.6 ppb. The average number of days/summer exceeding the 8-h regulatory standard increased 68%. Elevated ozone levels correspond to approximately a 0.11% to 0.27% increase in daily total mortality. While actual future ozone concentrations depend on climate and other influences such as changes in emissions of anthropogenic precursors, the results presented here indicate that with other factors constant, climate change could detrimentally affect air quality and thereby harm human health.",

Climate change was looked from the social dimensions like its impact on gender equality, health, population and human rights. Corporate social responsibility was looked from the regulations and CRS initiatives by organizations in Nigeria. The policies and regulations governing climate change was analyzed together with an examination of the regulation and concept of CSR in Nigeria. Social and environmental challenges and inadequate and irresponsible CSR initiatives by corporate organization form the problems that this study addresses. The study seeks to establish how unsuitable CSR initiatives by businesses derail climate change goals in Nigeria. A critical review and appraisal through library research on climate change and contributory factors was reviewed. The policies and regulations governing climate change was analyzed, together with an examination of the regulations and concept of CSR in Nigeria. It was found that climate change issues were poorly regulated with inadequate strategies for enforcement and with too much emphasis on mitigation than prevention by corporate organizations. Based on the findings, the study conclude that organizations have not paid the right attention to the issues of climate change in their CSR functions, rather organizations pay lip service to CSR obligations because organizations sees CSR as a voluntary affair with no mandating law for them to be sustainable and responsive to climatic issues in Nigeria. On the bases of this conclusion, the study recommends an enactment of laws with clear approach for the prevention of climate change related issues. Furthermore, CSR should be seen as an effective tool for ameliorating climate change issues by putting in place mandating laws that can change the perception of the organizations operating in Nigeria as this will ensure that organization in Nigeria respond to CSR initiatives with much sense of obligations.

As temperatures rise, ecosystems with 'nowhere to go', such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened2, 3. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate's ultimate persistence4, 5. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr-1), derived from spatial gradients (Â°CÂ km-1) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (Â°C\u2009yr-1) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42\u2009km\u2009yr-1 (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08\u2009km\u2009yr-1), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26\u2009km\u2009yr-1), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8\\% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100\u2009years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas6, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary7.",

However, some aspects of the Earth system, such as global mean temperatures1 and sea level rise due to thermal expansion2 or the melting of large ice sheets3, continue to respond long after the stabilization of radiative forcing. Here we use a coupled climate\u2013vegetation model to show that in turn the terrestrial biosphere shows significant inertia in its response to climate change. We demonstrate that the global terrestrial biosphere can continue to change for decades after climate stabilization. We suggest that ecosystems can be committed to long-term change long before any response is observable: for example, we find that the risk of significant loss of forest cover in Amazonia rises rapidly for a global mean temperature rise above 2Â Â°C.

Here we present an almost continuous tree-ring and climate record from Vancouver Island, Canada for the last four millennia from Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) that are sensitive to precipitation variation. Spring droughts more severe than that of the mid-1920s occurred in the late 1840s, mid-1460s AD, and ~ mid-1860s BC. A remarkable climatic anomaly occurred in ~ the 19th century BC during which strong pentadecadal oscillation prevailed and radial growth decreased by 71% in four years. This event could have been the final stage in the process of climatic and environmental transition beginning 2-3 centuries earlier that led to major cultural transformation in regions sensitive to climate change.",

Here we propose a conceptual framework for how to define and develop a set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for use within the scenario framework. We define SSPs as reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate policies. We introduce the concept of a space of challenges to adaptation and to mitigation that should be spanned by the SSPs, and discuss how particular trends in social, economic, and environmental development could be combined to produce such outcomes. A comparison to the narratives from the scenarios developed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) illustrates how a starting point for developing SSPs can be defined. We suggest initial development of a set of basic SSPs that could then be extended to meet more specific purposes, and envision a process of application of basic and extended SSPs that would be iterative and potentially lead to modification of the original SSPs themselves.",

A model is described to assess the relationship between changes in climate and the viability, technical and financial, of hydropower development.

Public opinion on climate change is influenced by social media platforms such as Twitter, often divided into believers and deniers. In this paper, we propose a framework to classify a tweet\u2019s stance on climate change (denier/believer). Existing approaches to stance detection and classification of climate change tweets either have paid little attention to the characteristics of deniers\u2019 tweets or often lack an appropriate architecture. However, the relevant literature reveals that the sentimental aspects and time perspective of climate change conversations on Twitter have a major impact on public attitudes and environmental orientation. Therefore, in our study, we focus on exploring the role of temporal orientation and sentiment analysis (auxiliary tasks) in detecting the attitude of tweets on climate change (main task). Our proposed framework STASY integrates word- and sentence-based feature encoders with the intra-task and shared-private attention frameworks to better encode the interactions between task-specific and shared features. We conducted our experiments on our novel curated climate change CLiCS dataset (2465 denier and 7235 believer tweets), two publicly available climate change datasets (ClimateICWSM-2022 and ClimateStance-2022), and two benchmark stance detection datasets (SemEval-2016 and COVID-19-Stance). Experiments show that our proposed approach improves stance detection performance (with an average improvement of 12.14% on our climate change dataset, 15.18% on ClimateICWSM-2022, 12.94% on ClimateStance-2022, 19.38% on SemEval-2016, and 35.01% on COVID-19-Stance in terms of average F1 scores) by benefiting from the auxiliary tasks compared to the baseline methods.",

Because coffee plantations have a lifespan of about thirty years, the likely effects of future climates are already a concern. Forward-looking research on adaptation is therefore in high demand across the entire supply chain. In this paper we seek to project current and future climate suitability for coffee production (Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora) on a global scale. We used machine learning algorithms to derive functions of climatic suitability from a database of geo-referenced production locations. Use of several parameter combinations enhances the robustness of our analysis. The resulting multi-model ensemble suggests that higher temperatures may reduce yields of C. arabica, while C. canephora could suffer from increasing variability of intra-seasonal temperatures. Climate change will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50Â \\% across emission scenarios. Impacts are highest at low latitudes and low altitudes. Impacts at higher altitudes and higher latitudes are still negative but less pronounced. The world's dominant production regions in Brazil and Vietnam may experience substantial reductions in area available for coffee. Some regions in East Africa and Asia may become more suitable, but these are partially in forested areas, which could pose a challenge to mitigation efforts.",

A basic argument supporting the claim that anthropogenic climate change violates human rights is presented. Four objections to this argument are examined: the \u2018future persons\u2019 objection; the \u2018risk\u2019 objection; the \u2018collective causation\u2019 objection; and the \u2018demandingness\u2019 objection.

In light of the changing climate, it is relevant to investigate to what extent climate change directly impacts future highly weather-dependent electricity systems. Here, we use three IPCC CO2 concentration pathways for the period 2006\u20132100 with six high-resolution climate experiments for the European domain. Climate data are used to calculate bias-adjusted 3-hourly time series of wind and solar generation and temperature-corrected demand time series for 30 European countries using a state-of-the-art methodology. Weather-driven electricity system analysis is then applied to compare five key metrics of highly renewable electricity systems. We find that climate change changes the need for dispatchable electricity by up to 20%. The remaining key metrics, such as the benefit of transmission and storage as well as requirements for balancing capacity and reserves, change by up to 5%.",

One possible response of cetacean species to these increases in water temperature is that species\u2019 ranges may change. Here, I provide a framework for assessing which cetacean species\u2019 ranges are likely to change as a result of increases in water temperature and whether they will expand, shift poleward or contract based on their current distributions. Based on this framework, it is predicted that the ranges of 88\\% of cetaceans may be affected by changes in water temperature resulting from global climate change. For 47\\% of species, these changes are anticipated to have\nunfavourable implications for their conservation, and for 21\\% the changes may put at least one geographically isolated population of the species at high risk of extinction. This framework suggests that\ncertain characteristics put some species at greater risk from such changes than others. These include\na range that is restricted to non-tropical waters (including temperate species) and a preference for\nshelf waters. These characteristics are shared by most porpoises and Lagenorhynchus species and by all members of the genus Cephalorhynchus. As a result, species in these taxa are potentially at particular\nrisk from changes in range in response to increasing water temperatures. However, further research is required to assess whether these predictions are, indeed, correct.",

The results illustrate that, across elevation zones, historical peak daily flows â©¾1-year return have a high frequency (&gt;60%) of association with ROS. The historical association between peak daily flows and ROS is highest within the transient rain and snow elevation band (350\u20131100&#xa0;m), with 80% and 100% of â©¾1 and â©¾5-year return peak flows associated with ROS, respectively. In a future with increased air temperature due to climate change, our results indicate that a decrease in the frequency of high peak flow ROS events will occur in the low and middle elevation zones while the frequency of ROS associated peak flows will increase in high elevation areas. The transition of winter precipitation from snow to rain is predicted to increase peak daily flows &lt;5\u201310-year return interval and decrease peak daily flows â©¾10-year return in the middle to high elevation zones.",

Social marketing approaches are becoming increasingly popular among governmental and non-governmental actors seeking to engage the public on climate change. The effectiveness of social marketing in achieving specific behavioural goals is empirically well-supported. However, in the first systematic critique of social marketing as a strategy for engaging the public on climate change, we present evidence that social marketing alone is insufficient to build support for the more ambitious policy changes and interventions that constitute a proportional response to climate change. In some circumstances, social marketing approaches may even be counterproductive. We describe some alternative approaches for engaging the public, which may provide governmental and non-governmental actors with additional or preferable tools for promoting public engagement with climate change. Given the scale of the challenge, it seems critical that those seeking to engage the public are equipped with the most effective strategies available \u2013 a goal that this paper seeks to contribute to.

For the historic period we draw upon a new observed global climate data set which allows us to explore aspects of regional climate change related to diurnal temperature range and rainfall variability. The latter includes an investigation of regions where seasonal rainfall is sensitive to El NiÃ±o climate variability. This review of past climate change provides the context for our scenarios of future greenhouse gas-induced climate change in Africa. These scenarios draw upon the draft emissions scenarios prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeÂ¹s Third Assessment Report, a suite of recent global climate model experiments, and a simple climate model to link these 2 sets of analyses. We present a range of 4 climate futures for Africa, focusing on changes in both continental and regional seasonal-mean temperature and rainfall. Estimates of associated changes in global CO2 concentration and global-mean sea-level change are also supplied. These scenarios draw upon some of the most recent climate modelling work. We also identify some fundamental limitations to knowledge with regard to future African climate. These include the often poor representation of El NiÃ±o climate variability in global climate models, and the absence in these models of any representation of regional changes in land cover and dust and biomass aerosol loadings. These omitted processes may well have important consequences for future African climates, especially at regional scales. We conclude by discussing the value of the sort of climate change scenarios presented here and how best they should be used in national and regional vulnerability and adaptation assessments.",

Generally, such scenarios rely on a finite number of model projections and are accompanied by considerable uncertainties which cannot be fully quantified. Consequently, probabilistic climate projections are conditioned on several subjective assumptions which can be treated in a Bayesian framework. In this study, a recently developed Bayesian multi-model combination algorithm is applied to regional climate model simulations from the ENSEMBLES project to generate probabilistic projections for Switzerland. The seasonal temperature and precipitation scenarios are calculated relative to 1980\u20132009 for three 30-year scenario periods (centred at 2035, 2060, and 2085), three regions, and the A1B emission scenario. Projections for two further emission scenarios are obtained by pattern scaling. Key to the Bayesian algorithm is the determination of prior distributions about climatic parameters. It is shown that the prior choice of model projection uncertainty ultimately determines the uncertainty in the climate change signal. Here, we assume that model uncertainty is fully sampled by the climate models available. We have extended the algorithm such that internal decadal variability is also included in all scenario calculations. The A1B scenarios show a significant rise in temperature increasing from 0.9\u20131.4 Â°C by 2035 (depending upon region and season), to 2.0\u20132.9 Â°C by 2060, and to 2.7\u20134.1 Â°C by 2085. Mean precipitation changes are subject to large uncertainties with median changes close to zero. Significant signals are seen towards the end of the century with a summer drying of 18\u201324% depending on region, and a likely increase of winter precipitation in Switzerland south of the Alps. The A2 scenario implies a warming of 3.2\u20134.8 Â°C, and a summer drying of 21\u201328% by 2085, while in case of the mitigation scenario RCP3PD, climate change could be stabilized to 1.2\u20131.8 Â°C of warming and 8\u201310% of drying.

Climate models do not produce probabilities, nor are they perfect representations of the real climate, and there are complex inter-relationships due to shared model features. This creates interesting statistical challenges for making inference about the real climate.These issues were the focus of discussions at an Isaac Newton Institute workshop on probabilistic prediction of climate change held at the University of Exeter on 20\u201323 September 2010. This article presents a summary of the issues discussed between the statisticians, mathematicians, and climate scientists present at the workshop. In addition, we also report the discussion that took place on how to define the concept of climate. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

In this study we use an ensemble of the HadCM3 climate model forced with a range of future emissions scenarios combined with a simple water scarcity index to assess the contribution of each of these factors to the projected population living in water stress over the 21st century.\n\nPopulation change only scenarios increase the number of people living in water stress such that at peak global population 65\\% of people experience some level of water stress. Globally, the climate model ensemble projects an increase in water availability which partially offsets some of the impacts of population growth. The result is 1 billion fewer people living in water stress by the 2080s under the high end emissions scenarios than if population increased in the absence of climate change.\n\nThis study highlights the important role plant-physiological forcing has on future water resources. The effect of rising CO2 is to increase available water and to reduce the number of people living in high water stress by around 200 million compared to climate only projections. This effect is of a similar order of magnitude to climate change.",

In the present study, past trends in extreme precipitation and future projections using an ensemble of regional climate models (RCM) are evaluated. The extreme precipitation distributions during the extended winter season (October to April) in 10 stations are fitted with Generalized Extreme Value models (GEV). The dependence of the GEV parameters with time, winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Mediterranean Oscillation (MO) indexes have been tested. Results indicate no significant trends in extreme precipitation during the observation period 1961Ã¢\u0080\u00932007. However, dependences between precipitation extremes and NAO or MO indexes are detected, in particular for the Atlantic stations. Then 15 RCM simulations provided by the ENSEMBLES European project ran with the A1B scenario are considered to provide future projections. The CramÃÂ©rÃ¢\u0080\u0093von Mises (CM) statistic is introduced as a measure of adequacy between the observed extreme precipitation distributions at the different stations and the distributions simulated by the RCMs. The CM statistic can thus provide weights to build a multi-model ensemble of future projections based on model performance in the present climate. Even if some models exhibit good skills, there is a great variability in the RCM performances to reproduce the seasonal cycle and the extreme precipitation distributions at the different stations. The projected changes on extreme precipitation at the stations are evaluated with quantiles computed for different return periods, ranging from 2 to 40&#xa0;years, during the control period 1961Ã¢\u0080\u00932007 and two projection periods, 2020Ã¢\u0080\u00932050 and 2070Ã¢\u0080\u00932099. The climate change scaling factors on extreme quantiles provided by the different RCMs are averaged with equal weights, or with weights obtained from the inverse of the CM statistic. The climate change signal in the RCM simulations indicate a decrease in extreme precipitation quantiles, Ã¢\u0088\u0092&#xa0;12% in average for the projection period 2070Ã¢\u0080\u00932099 but a great variability and lower convergence between models is found for the projection period 2020Ã¢\u0080\u00932050. Overall, there is a good model convergence towards a decrease for the Atlantic stations. For the Mediterranean stations, the projected changes are difficult to assess due to the great variability. The two weighting schemes tested for model outputs provide similar results.",

The various climate change risks which were faced by rural farmers of Kaushambi are water quality, flooding of ponds, less rain, heavy mortality of fishes, planktonic collapse, long dry spells, disease outbreak, destruction of embankments etc. The study also includes the measures to encounter these risks. To maintain the quality of water the farmers have used lime, manure, alum, KMnO4, salt and exchange of water. To control the flooding of ponds the farmers raises embankments by bamboo fencing with net. They have filled their ponds with pumps from canals / rivers and tube well water to face the problem of less rain and long dry spells. To avoid the heavy mortality of the fishes they have used early harvest, liming, shading and water movement by beating of water for oxygenation. To overcome with the planktonic collapse the farmers have used cow dung, gobar gas slurry, use of khari, choker in the water and exchange of 50 percent water. To control the disease outbreak the farmers have adopted lime, KMnO4, medicines, neem leaves, banana stem etc.",

Future climate change will likely affect these storm tracks and the associated transport of energy, momentum, and water vapour. Many recent studies have analyzed how storm tracks will change under climate change, and how these changes are related to atmospheric dynamics. However, there are still discrepancies between different studies on how storm tracks will change under future climate scenarios. Here, we show that under global warming the CMIP5 ensemble of coupled climate models projects only little relative changes in vertically averaged mid-latitude mean storm track activity during the northern winter, but agree in projecting a substantial decrease during summer. Seasonal changes in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite behaviour, with an intensification in winter and no change during summer. These distinct seasonal changes in northern summer and southern winter storm tracks lead to an amplified seasonal cycle in a future climate. Similar changes are seen in the mid-latitude mean Eady growth rate maximum, a measure that combines changes in vertical shear and static stability based on baroclinic instability theory. Regression analysis between changes in the storm tracks and changes in the maximum Eady growth rate reveal that most models agree in a positive association between the two quantities over mid-latitude regions.",

To illustrate the potential problem, a sen- sitivity analysis is presented that considers the impact of altered precipitation and temperature on river ï¬ows, energy production, and ï¬nancial performance measures of a planned hydro scheme in Sub-Saharan Africa. The behaviour of the river basin was found to amplify changes in precipitation and, although the design and planned operational strategy of the station tended to moderate the impact, the overall ï¬nancial impact remained signiï¬cant. Compar- ison with (nonclimate) project parameters indicated that ï¬nancial performance, not surprisingly, depends strongly on discount rate and electricity sales price and that, importantly, it showed a similar sensitivity to precipitation change and rising temperature. Critical changes in climate were identiï¬ed in order to indicate the severity of climate change that could be tolerated before the project becomes ï¬nancially nonviable.",

The awareness was measured in terms of education, agriculture, health, fishery and marine resources, infrastructure and human settlement, and environment and natural resources. The study also found the correlation of the level of awareness and selected personal variables and the significant difference in the awareness among the groups of respondents. The study employed the descriptive correlation method of research utilizing a 30 item Liker type instrument on awareness on climate change adaptation. Data were analyzed using percentages, means, multiple regression analysis, and analysis of variance. The findings of the study showed that the faculty members were much aware on climate change adaptation in terms of education, agriculture, and health and aware on climate change adaptation in terms of fishery and marine resources, infrastructure, and environment and natural resources. The students were much aware on climate change adaptation in terms of education, agriculture, and health and aware on climate change adaptation in terms of fishery and marine resources, infrastructure, and environment and natural resources. The nonteaching personnel were aware on the six components of the level of awareness. For the faculty members and non teaching personnel, the exposure to newspaper and television were found to be significantly related to the level of awareness on climate adaptation. For the students, the exposure to newspaper and year level were found to be significantly related to the level of awareness on climate adaptation. There is a significant difference in the level of awareness on climate change adaptation among the three groups of respondents.

Climate change could alter the frequency of occurrence of these impacts. We have therefore investigated the climate change impact on various temperature-related issues, identified during workshops with rail industry specialists, using a perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) of the Met Office's regional climate model (RCM), HadRM3. We have developed novel approaches to combine RCM data with railway industry knowledge, typically by identifying key meteorological thresholds of interest and analysing exceedance of these out to the 2040s. We performed a statistical analysis of the projected changes for each issue, via bootstrapping of the unperturbed PPE member. Although neither the PPE nor the bootstrapping analysis samples the full range of uncertainty in the projections, they nonetheless provide complementary perspectives on the suitability of the projections for use in decision-making. Our main findings include projected increases in the summertime occurrence of temperature conditions associated with (i) track buckling, (ii) overhead power line sag, (iii) exposure of outdoor workers to heat stress, and (iv) heat-related delays to track maintenance; and (v) projected decreases in the wintertime occurrence of temperatures conditions associated with freight train failure owing to brake problems. For (i), the statistical significance varied with track condition and location; for (ii) and (iii), with location; and for (iv) and (v), projected changes were significant across Great Britain. As well as assessing the changes in climate-related hazard, information about the vulnerability of the network to past temperature-related incidents has been summarised. Combining the hazard and vulnerability elements will eventually support a climate risk assessment for the industry.",

Although both reports represent summaries of empirical research within the same scientific discipline, our language analyses revealed consistent and substantial differences between them. Most notably, the IPCC authors used more cautious (as opposed to certain) language than the NIPCC authors. This finding (among others) indicates that, contrary to that which is commonly claimed by skeptics, IPCC authors were actually more conservative in terms of language style than their NIPCC counterparts. The political controversy over climate change may cause proponents' language to be conservative (for fear of being attacked) and opponents' language to be aggressive (to more effectively attack). This has clear implications for the science communication of climate research.",

We compare the distributions of annual mean significant wave height, mean wave energy period and wave power density in a present-day (1981\u20132010) and future (2040\u20132069) period, using a high resolution (\\~ 8km) wave model driven by a perturbed physics ensemble of dynamically downscaled regional climate model simulations. The five ensemble members were chosen (from a pool of 11) to sample the range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, under an A1B emissions scenario. The present-day wave climate simulations were found to systematically overestimate wave energy periods when compared to an observation-based wave hindcast. There was more similarity in the wave heights, although some members still differed significantly. We tested for changes in the annual-mean wave parameters in the 2050s period. The ensemble member with the highest climate sensitivity showed a statistically significant reduction in mean significant wave height, but this was not seen in the other members. No member showed a significant change in wave energy period or wave power density. The climate change-induced differences in the wave parameters are smaller than the uncertainty of the wave climate projections, and the interannual variability of the wave climate itself, in both periods. Therefore characterising the interannual variability at these sites remains at least as important as the impact of climate change for assessing wave power output around Britain out to the 2050s.",

However, wind energy is also susceptible to global climate change. Some changes associated with climate evolution will likely benefit the wind energy industry while other changes may negatively impact wind energy developments, with such 'gains and losses' depending on the region under consideration. Herein we review possible mechanisms by which global climate variability and change may influence the wind energy resource and operating conditions, summarize some of the tools that are being employed to quantify these effects and the sources of uncertainty in making such projections, and discuss results of studies conducted to date. We present illustrative examples of research from northern Europe. Climate change analyses conducted for this region, which has shown considerable penetration of wind energy, imply that in the near-term (i.e. to the middle of the current century) natural variability exceeds the climate change signal in the wind energy resource and extreme wind speeds, but there will likely be a decline in icing frequency and sea ice both of which will tend to benefit the wind energy industry. By the end of the twenty-first century there is evidence for small magnitude changes in the wind resource (though the sign of the change remains uncertain), for increases in extreme wind speeds, and continued declines in sea ice and icing frequencies. Thus the current state-of-the-art suggests no detectable change in the wind resource or other external conditions that could jeopardize the continued exploitation of wind energy in northern Europe, though further research is needed to provide greater confidence in these projections.",

The paleo-simulations in which the model is driven by orbital forcing only, i.e., by changes in insolation caused by changes in the Earth's orbit, are compared with sensitivity simulations in which various scenarios of increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration are prescribed. Focussing on climate and vegetation change in northern Africa, we recapture the strong greening of the Sahara in the early and mid-Holocene (some 9000\u20136000 years ago), and we show that some expansion of grasslandinto the Sahara is theoretically possible, if the atmospheric CO 2 concentration increases well above pre-industrial values and if vegetation growth is not disturbed. Depending on the rate of CO 2 increase, vegetation migration into the Sahara can be rapid, up to 1/10th of the Saharan area per decade, but could not exceed a coverage of 45\\%. In ourmodel, vegetation expansion into today's Sahara is triggered by an increase in summer precipitation which is amplified by a positive feedback between vegetation and precipitation. This is valid for simulations with orbital forcing and greenhouse-gas forcing. However, we argue that the mid-Holocene climate optimum some 9000 to 6000 years ago with its marked reduction of deserts in northern Africa is not a direct analogue for future greenhouse-gas induced climate change, as previously hypothesized. Not only does the global pattern of climate change differ between the mid-Holocene model experiments and the greenhouse-gas sensitivity experiments, but the relative role of mechanisms which lead to a reduction of the Sahara also changes. Moreover, the amplitude of simulated vegetation cover changes in northern Africa is less than is estimated for mid-Holocene climate.",

We depict the theoretically predicted changes and diagnose physical mechanisms for observational and model-projected trends in large-scale and regional climate. The tropical circulation slows down with moisture and stratification changes, connecting to a poleward expansion of the Hadley cells and a shift of the intertropical convergence zone. Redistributions of regional precipitation consist of thermodynamic and dynamical components, including a strong offset between moisture increase and circulation weakening throughout the tropics. This allows other dynamical processes to dominate local circulation changes, such as a surface warming pattern effect over oceans and multiple mechanisms over land. To improve reliability in climate projections, more fundamental understandings of pattern formation, circulation change, and the balance of various processes redistributing land rainfall are suggested to be important.",

The study is based on 222,060 papers (articles and reviews only) published between 1980 and 2014. The total number of papers shows a strong increase with a doubling every 5\u20136 years. Continental biomass related research is the major subfield, closely followed by climate modeling. Research dealing with adaptation, mitigation, risks, and vulnerability of global warming is comparatively small, but their share of papers increased exponentially since 2005. Research on vulnerability and on adaptation published the largest proportion of very important papers (in terms of citation impact). Climate change research has become an issue also for disciplines beyond the natural sciences. The categories Engineering and Social Sciences show the strongest field-specific relative increase. The Journal of Geophysical Research, the Journal of Climate, the Geophysical Research Letters, and Climatic Change appear at the top positions in terms of the total number of papers published. Research on climate change is quantitatively dominated by the USA, followed by the UK, Germany, and Canada. The citation-based indicators exhibit consistently that the UK has produced the largest proportion of high impact papers compared to the other countries (having published more than 10,000 papers). Also, Switzerland, Denmark and also The Netherlands (with a publication output between around 3,000 and 6,000 papers) perform top\u2014the impact of their contributions is on a high level. The title word analysis shows that the term climate change comes forward with time. Furthermore, the term impact arises and points to research dealing with the various effects of climate change. The discussion of the question of human induced climate change towards a clear fact (for the majority of the scientific community) stimulated research on future pathways for adaptation and mitigation. Finally, the term model and related terms prominently appear independent of time, indicating the high relevance of climate modeling.",

Along with a possible increased hazard of tropical cyclones due to global warming, there is an inescapable increase in vulnerability and disaster risk towards tropical cyclones due to population growth and coastal infrastructure developments. In Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula has the highest landfall rates of major category hurricanes in addition to the highest rate of population growth in major tourist cities. Therefore, the assessment of landfalling tropical cyclones is of paramount importance for emergency management and planning. This paper provides an assessment of the future climate for landfalling tropical cyclones in the Yucatan Peninsula, based on synthetic tropical cyclones driven by atmospheric models (reanalysis and six different general circulation models (GCMs)) and under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate change scenario. The results using the ensemble mean from the GCMs show that the Yucatan Peninsula will be more susceptible to more frequent intense hurricanes and more regular events undergoing rapid intensification. We conclude that even under the uncertainty imposed by the results, it is more likely than not that the future climate will bring more extreme events to this area. Therefore, it becomes imperative to implement strategic planning based on the characterization of tropical cyclone hazards framed within the assessment of global warming effects.

At the same time, the world's leading decision makers seem to finally be waking up to the emergency. For instance, the European Union (EU) just announced 1 trillion euro plan to support the European Green Deal, including a mechanism designed to help regions (e.g., coal-dependent Poland) that would be most disrupted economically by the transition to cleaner industries. Moreover, with the aim to make Europe the world's first carbon-neutral continent by 2050, the EU pledges a just transition, that is to ``leave no one behind.''",

Data from social ecological survey was analysed after entry in to statistical package for social sciences to get the respondents' views of livelihood capitals. The majority of the respondents 58.5% in Yaaku community indicated that politicians addressed issues of climate change in the community, with only 18.3% and 30.8% of them said that climate change issues were addressed by professionals and administrators respectively. However similar respondent of opinion of 45.4%, 35.4% and 17.9% said it was politicians, professionals and administrators who address development issues respectively. The majority 70.4% of the respondents gave their opinion that politicians and other leaders do not understand climate related risks on livelihoods while a small minority 29.6% were on the opinion that the politicians and other leaders understood climate related risks on the livelihoods in pastoral communities. Politicians being the main decision makers on development issues in local set up in developing countries where Kenya is one of them, decisions on climate change and adaption need be discussed and understood by politicians. Therefore policy formulation is needed as from county and national level on how to mainstream politicians in issues of climate change and adaptations. Therefore the politicians were key in addressing the impacts of climate change although they had not known or understood that the impacts are of climate change but either campaign goodies or development agenda. Therefore to address climate change impacts and their adaptations strategies political angle need be applied which makes political influence capital a main livelihood capital in addressing issues of climate change.

The negotiations there will be based on national pledges, formally known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, with the goal of setting the world on a sustainable path.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has long emphasised to its members and the world at large that energy production and use which is not compatible with international environmental requirements is not sustainable: it fails the test of energy security. The IEA, therefore, feels an obligation to make a contribution to COP21 \u2013 a contribution which reconciles climate and energy needs. That is the purpose of this special report in the World Energy Outlook series.\n\nThe report:\n\n    Presents a detailed first assessment of the energy sector impact of known and signalled national climate pledges for COP21.\n\n    Proposes a bridging strategy to deliver a near-term peak in global energy-related greenhouse-gas emissions, based on five pragmatic measures that can advance climate goals through the energy sector without blunting economic growth.\n\n    Highlights the urgent need to accelerate the development of emerging technologies that are, ultimately, essential to transforming the global energy system into one that is consistent with the world's climate goals.\n\n    Recommends four key pillars on which COP21 can build success, from an energy sector perspective.",

Most models showed high pattern correlations. With respect to the explained spatial variance, many models showed serious large-scale deficiencies, especially at mid-latitudes. Five models performed well at all latitudes and for each month of the year. Three models had a reasonable skill.  We selected the five models with the best pressure patterns for a more detailed assessment of their simulations of the climate in Central Europe. We analysed observations and simulations of monthly mean geostrophic flow indices and of monthly mean temperature and precipitation. We used three geostrophic flow indices: the west component and south component of the geostrophic wind at the surface and the geostrophic vorticity. We found that circulation biases were important, and affected precipitation in particular. Apart from these circulation biases, the models showed other biases in temperature and precipitation, which were for some models larger than the circulation induced biases. For the 21st century the five models simulated quite different changes in circulation, precipitation and temperature. Precipitation changes appear to be primarily caused by circulation changes. Since the models show widely different circulation changes, especially in late summer, precipitation changes vary widely between the models as well. Some models simulate severe drying in late summer, while one model simulates significant precipitation increases in late summer. With respect to the mean temperature the circulation changes were important, but not dominant. However, changes in the distribution of monthly mean temperatures, do show large indirect influences of circulation changes. Especially in late summer, two models simulate very strong warming of warm months, which can be attributed to severe summer drying in the simulations by these models. The models differ also significantly in the simulated warming of cold winter months. Finally, the models simulate rather different changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature, which is likely to impact on changes in temperature and precipitation. These results imply that several important aspects of climate change in Central Europe are highly uncertain. Other aspects of the simulated climate change appear to be more robust. All models simulate significant warming all year round and an increase in precipitation in the winter half-year.",

We present an empirical document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187 climate change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and paid, editorial-style advertisements ('advertorials') in The New York Times. We examine whether these communications sent consistent messages about the state of climate science and its implications\u2014specifically, we compare their positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious, and solvable. In all four cases, we find that as documents become more publicly accessible, they increasingly communicate doubt. This discrepancy is most pronounced between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for expressions of reasonable doubt, 83\\% of peer-reviewed papers and 80\\% of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12\\% of advertorials do so, with 81\\% instead expressing doubt. We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science\u2014by way of its scientists' academic publications\u2014but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil's discussion of the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed and sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent from advertorials. Finally, based on the available documents, we outline ExxonMobil's strategic approach to climate change research and communication, which helps to contextualize our findings.",

However, current understanding of livelihood vulnerability to climate change is based on a fractured and disparate set of theories and methods. This review therefore combines theoretical insights from sustainable livelihoods analysis with other analytical frameworks (including the ecosystem services framework, diffusion theory, social learning, adaptive management and transitions management) to assess the vulnerability of rural livelihoods to climate change. This integrated analytical framework helps diagnose vulnerability to climate change, whilst identifying and comparing adaptation options that could reduce vulnerability, following four broad steps: i) determine likely level of exposure to climate change, and how climate change might interact with existing stresses and other future drivers of change; ii) determine the sensitivity of stocks of capital assets and flows of ecosystem services to climate change; iii) identify factors influencing decisions to develop and/or adopt different adaptation strategies, based on innovation or the use/substitution of existing assets; and iv) identify and evaluate potential trade-offs between adaptation options. The paper concludes by identifying interdisciplinary research needs for assessing the vulnerability of livelihoods to climate change.",

The ensemble simulation is based on the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology climate model, ECHAM6, where all members have been exposed to the identically same radiative forcing. The range of global mean surface temperature warming over the 1850--2005 period, based on all members, is 0.65--1.10Â Â°C. The distribution of the global mean surface temperature about the ensemble mean has a standard deviation (StD) of ËÃ¾inspace0.14Â Â°C which slowly decreases in time. Regionally, the largest decrease in the ensemble StD occurs in the Northern Hemisphere winter. Comparing the temporal StD with that from the observed HadCRUT4 surface temperature data indicates that the majority of the ensemble members have a larger temporal StD than the observations suggesting that the model simulations might overestimate the variance. There are clear random 20-year linear trends in global mean surface temperature anomalies as well as significant regional 50-year linear trends. Even with an ensemble mean warming trend, typical of the early twenty-first century, a global hiatus in temperature of 20Â years duration is possible to occur by chance. The results support the view that observed decadal and multi-decadal anomalies in the twentieth century were significantly influenced by internal processes of the climate system. This is particularly the case for the observed global warming trend of 1910--1940 and the global cooling trend of 1940--1970. Global mean precipitation hardly increases with time in the ensemble simulations, but in agreement with theory regional changes occur, with increasing precipitation in polar regions and in some tropical areas. In the subtropics there are reductions in precipitation. Long-lasting regional anomalies of significant amplitudes occur by chance in the ensemble integration.",

Warming has occurred in all months excepting June. Annual precipitation decreased since the mid 1960s, so that the 1990s was the driest of the five decades that precipitation has been measured at the island. All months excepting October have become drier. The interannual variability in annual total sunshine hours was large, and irregular, but a significant proportion of that variability could be ascribed to an average increase of 3.3 hours each year between 1951 and 1999. Hours of sunshine increased for all months in that period. It is argued that the Antarctic region has not taken its rightful place in studies of the biological and ecological effects of climate change and that sub-Antarctic islands, especially, have much to offer in this field. Climatic change will directly affect the indigenous biota sub-Antarctic islands. An even greater threat is that a warmer climate will increase the ease with which the islands can be invaded by alien species and examples are given of how climatic change and invasive organisms influence the biota and ecology of Marion Island.",

In tropical ecosystems, regional climate projections and modeled ecosystem responses vary greatly, leading to a significant source of uncertainty in global biogeochemical accounting and possible future climate feedbacks. Here, we combine an ensemble of IPCC-AR4 climate change projections for the Amazon Basin (eight general circulation models) with alternative ecosystem parameter sets for the dynamic global vegetation model, LPJmL. We evaluate LPJmL simulations of carbon stocks and fluxes against flux tower and aboveground biomass datasets for individual sites and the entire basin. Variability in LPJmL model sensitivity to future climate change is primarily related to light and water limitations through biochemical and water-balance-related parameters. Temperature-dependent parameters related to plant respiration and photosynthesis appear to be less important than vegetation dynamics (and their parameters) for determining the magnitude of ecosystem response to climate change. Variance partitioning approaches reveal that relationships between uncertainty from ecosystem dynamics and climate projections are dependent on geographic location and the targeted ecosystem process. Parameter uncertainty from the LPJmL model does not affect the trajectory of ecosystem response for a given climate change scenario and the primary source of uncertainty for Amazon 'dieback' results from the uncertainty among climate projections. Our approach for describing uncertainty is applicable for informing and prioritizing policy options related to mitigation and adaptation where long-term investments are required.",

The exploding popularity of social networks, however, presents a new opportunity to research the spatiotemporal pattern of public discourse in relation to natural and/or socio-economic events. Among the social networks, Twitter is one of the largest microblogging services. The architecture of Twitter makes the question  \u201D what's happening?\u201D the cornerstone of information exchange. This inspired the notion of using Twitter users as distributed sensors, which has been successfully employed in both the natural and social sciences. In 2012 and 2013, we collected 1.8 million tweets on  \u201D climate change\u201D and  \u201D global warming\u201D in five major languages (English, German, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish). We discuss the geography of tweeting, weekly and daily patterns, major news events that affected tweeting on climate change, changes in the central topics of discussion over time, the most authoritative traditional media, blogging, and the most authoritative organizational sources of information on climate change referenced by Twitter users in different countries. We anticipate that social network mining will become a major source of data in the public discourse on climate change.",

In this article, we review the risk of climate-related impacts along the land-based livestock food supply chain. Although a quantification of the net impacts of climate change on the livestock sector is beyond the reach of our current understanding, there is strong evidence that there will be impacts throughout the supply chain, from farm production to processing operations, storage, transport, retailing and human consumption. The risks of climate-related impacts are highly context-specific but expected to be higher in environments that are already hot and have limited socio-economic and institutional resources for adaptation. Large uncertainties remain as to climate futures and the exposure and responses of the interlinked human and natural systems to climatic changes over time. Consequently, adaptation choices will need to account for a wide range of possible futures, including those with low probability but large consequences.",

In this Review we discuss infections acquired through various routes (arthropod vector, rodent, water, food, and air) in view of a changing climate in Europe. Based on an extensive review of published work and expert workshops, we present an assessment of the infectious disease challenges: incidence, prevalence, and distribution are projected to shift in a changing environment. Due to the high level of uncertainty on the rate of climate change and its impact on infectious diseases, we propose to mount a proactive public health response by building an integrated network for environmental and epidemiological data. This network would have the capacity to connect epidemic intelligence and infectious disease surveillance with meteorological, entomological, water quality, remote sensing, and other data, for multivariate analyses and predictions. Insights from these analyses could then guide adaptation strategies and protect population health from impending threats related to climate change.",

Data on the vector tick Ixodes ricinus suggest that an extension of its northern and altitude range has been accompanied by an increased prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis. Climate change may also be partly responsible for the change in distribution of Dermacentor reticulatus. Increased winter activity of I. ricinus is probably due to warmer winters and a retrospective study suggests that hotter summers will change the dynamics and pattern of seasonal activity, resulting in the bulk of the tick population becoming active in the latter part of the year. Climate suitability models predict that eight important tick species are likely to establish more northern permanent populations in a climate-warming scenario. However, the complex ecology and epidemiology of such tick-borne diseases as Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis make it difficult to implicate climate change as the main cause of their increasing prevalence. Climate change models are required that take account of the dynamic biological processes involved in vector abundance and pathogen transmission in order to predict future tick-borne disease scenarios.",

Utilizing IRS data, total annual income is compiled for a sample of CCCM organizations (including advocacy organizations, think tanks, and trade associations). These data are coupled with IRS data on philanthropic foundation funding of these CCCM organizations contained in the Foundation Center\u2019s data base. This results in a data sample that contains financial information for the time period 2003 to 2010 on the annual income of 91 CCCM organizations funded by 140 different foundations. An examination of these data shows that these 91 CCCM organizations have an annual income of just over $900 million, with an annual average of $64 million in identifiable foundation support. The overwhelming majority of the philanthropic support comes from conservative foundations. Additionally, there is evidence of a trend toward concealing the sources of CCCM funding through the use of donor directed philanthropies.",

The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.",

The approach is based upon PDFs for the equilibrium response to doubled carbon dioxide, derived from a comprehensive sampling of uncertainties in modelling of surface and atmospheric processes, and constrained by multiannual mean observations of recent climate. These PDFs are sampled and scaled by global mean temperature predicted by a Simple Climate Model (SCM), in order to emulate corresponding transient responses. The sampled projections are then reweighted, based upon the likelihood that they correctly replicate observed historical changes in surface temperature, and combined to provide PDFs for 20Â year averages of regional temperature and precipitation changes to the end of the twenty-first century, for the A1B emissions scenario. The PDFs also account for modelling uncertainties associated with aerosol forcing, ocean heat uptake and the terrestrial carbon cycle, sampled using SCM configurations calibrated to the response of perturbed physics ensembles generated using the Hadley Centre climate model HadCM3, and other international climate model simulations. Weighting the projections using observational metrics of recent mean climate is found to be as effective at constraining the future transient response as metrics based on historical trends. The spread in global temperature response due to modelling uncertainty in the carbon cycle feedbacks is determined to be about 65\u201380Â \\% of the spread arising from uncertainties in modelling atmospheric, oceanic and aerosol processes of the climate system. Early twenty-first century aerosol forcing is found to be extremely unlikely to be less than â1.7Â WÂ mâ2. Our technique provides a rigorous and formal method of combining several lines of evidence used in the previous IPCC expert assessment of the Transient Climate Response. The 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of our observationally constrained PDF for the Transient Climate Response are 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4Â Â°C respectively, compared with the 10\u201390Â \\% range of 1.0\u20133.0Â Â°C assessed by the IPCC.",

Here we show that this is true regarding expressions of uncertainty, unless they are also accompanied by acknowledgements of irreducible uncertainty. A representative national sample of Americans read predictions about effects of global warming on sea level that included either a worst-case scenario (high partially bounded uncertainty) or the best and worst cases (fully bounded uncertainty). Compared to a control condition, expressing fully bounded but not high partially bounded uncertainty increased trust in scientists and message acceptance. However, these effects were eliminated when fully bounded uncertainty was accompanied by an acknowledgement that the full effects of sea-level rise cannot be quantified because of unpredictable storm surges. Thus, expressions of fully bounded uncertainty alone may enhance confidence in scientists and their assertions but not when the full extent of inevitable uncertainty is acknowledged.",

However, recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model predictions and there remains a pressing need to validate models and to reduce uncertainties. Model validation is problematic as predictions are made for events that have not yet occurred. Resubstituition and data partitioning of present-day data sets are, therefore, commonly used to test the predictive performance of models. However, these approaches suffer from the problems of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the calibration and validation sets. Using observed distribution shifts among 116 British breeding-bird species over the past 223C20 years, we are able to provide a first independent validation of four envelope modelling techniques under climate change. Results showed good to fair predictive performance on independent validation, although rules used to assess model performance are difficult to interpret in a decision-planning context. We also showed that measures of performance on nonindependent data provided optimistic estimates of models' predictive ability on independent data. Artificial neural networks and generalized additive models provided generally more accurate predictions of species range shifts than generalized linear models or classification tree analysis. Data for independent model validation and replication of this study are rare and we argue that perfect validation may not in fact be conceptually possible. We also note that usefulness of models is contingent on both the questions being asked and the techniques used. Implementations of species2013climate envelope models for testing hypotheses and predicting future events may prove wrong, while being potentially useful if put into appropriate context.",

Food systems encompass food availability (production, distribution and exchange), food access (affordability, allocation and preference) and food utilization (nutritional and societal values and safety), so that food security is, therefore, diminished when food systems are stressed. Such stresses may be induced by a range of factors in addition to climate change and/or other agents of environmental change (e.g. conflict, HIV/AIDS) and may be particularly severe when these factors act in combination. Urbanization and globalization are causing rapid changes to food systems. Climate change may affect food systems in several ways ranging from direct effects on crop production (e.g. changes in rainfall leading to drought or flooding, or warmer or cooler temperatures leading to changes in the length of growing season), to changes in markets, food prices and supply chain infrastructure. The relative importance of climate change for food security differs between regions. For example, in southern Africa, climate is among the most frequently cited drivers of food insecurity because it acts both as an underlying, ongoing issue and as a short-lived shock. The low ability to cope with shocks and to mitigate long-term stresses means that coping strategies that might be available in other regions are unavailable or inappropriate. In other regions, though, such as parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain of India, other drivers, such as labour issues and the availability and quality of ground water for irrigation, rank higher than the direct effects of climate change as factors influencing food security. Because of the multiple socio-economic and bio-physical factors affecting food systems and hence food security, the capacity to adapt food systems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change is not uniform. Improved systems of food production, food distribution and economic access may all contribute to food systems adapted to cope with climate change, but in adopting such changes it will be important to ensure that they contribute to sustainability. Agriculture is a major contributor of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), so that regionally derived policies promoting adapted food systems need to mitigate further climate change.",

However, general circulation models (GCMs), which are among the most advanced tools for estimating future climate change scenarios, operate on a coarse scale. Therefore the output from a GCM has to be downscaled to obtain the information relevant to hydrologic studies. In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) approach is proposed for statistical downscaling of precipitation at monthly time scale. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through its application to meteorological sub-divisions (MSDs) in India. First, climate variables affecting spatio-temporal variation of precipitation at each MSD in India are identified. Following this, the data pertaining to the identified climate variables (predictors) at each MSD are classified using cluster analysis to form two groups, representing wet and dry seasons. For each MSD, SVM- based downscaling model (DM) is developed for season(s) with significant rainfall using principal components extracted from the predictors as input and the contemporaneous precipitation observed at the MSD as an output. The proposed DM is shown to be superior to conventional downscaling using multi-layer back-propagation artificial neural networks. Subsequently, the SVM-based DM is applied to future climate predictions from the second generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM2) to obtain future projections of precipitation for the MSDs. The results are then analyzed to assess the impact of climate change on precipitation over India. It is shown that SVMs provide a promising alternative to conventional artificial neural networks for statistical downscaling, and are suitable for conducting climate impact studies.",

Therefore, climatic changes induced by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases may be expected to have significant effects on air quality. Because of the spatial variability of the pollutant emissions and climate-change signals, these effects are particularly relevant at the regional to local scales. This paper first briefly reviews modelling tools and methodologies used to study regional climate-change impacts on air quality. Patterns of regional precipitation, temperature, and sea-level changes emerging from the latest set of general circulation model projections are then discussed. Finally, the specific case of climate-change effects on summer ozone concentrations over Europe is presented to illustrate the potential impacts of climate change on pollutant amounts. It is concluded that climate change is an important factor that needs to be taken into account when designing future pollution-reduction policies.",

The aim is to provide a basis for probabilistic predictions in which the impact of prior assumptions and observational constraints can be clearly distinguished. Here we report on the first perturbed physics coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean model ensemble in which poorly constrained atmosphere, land and sea-ice component parameters are varied in the third version of the Hadley Centre model (the variation of ocean parameters will be the subject of future study). Flux adjustments are employed, both to reduce regional sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases and also to admit the use of combinations of model parameter values which give non-zero values for the global radiation balance. This improves the extent to which the ensemble provides a credible basis for the quantification of uncertainties in climate change, especially at a regional level. However, this particular implementation of flux-adjustments leads to a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, resulting in the development of biases in SST and sea ice in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, model versions are produced which are of similar quality to the unperturbed and un-flux-adjusted version. The ensemble is used to simulate pre-industrial conditions and a simple scenario of a 1\\% per year compounded increase in CO2. The range of transient climate response (the 20Â year averaged global warming at the time of CO2 doubling) is 1.5\u20132.6Â°C, similar to that found in multi-model studies. Measures of global and large scale climate change from the coupled models show simple relationships with associated measures computed from atmosphere-mixed-layer-ocean climate change experiments, suggesting that recent advances in computing the probability density function of climate change under equilibrium conditions using the perturbed physics approach may be extended to the transient case.",

As temperatures rise, ecosystems with 'nowhere to go', such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate's ultimate persistence. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr(-1)), derived from spatial gradients ( degrees C km(-1)) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase ( degrees C yr(-1)) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr(-1) (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr(-1)), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr(-1)), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8\\% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary.",

         "abstract": "Ticks and tick-borne diseases remain a burden to the livestock industry in sub-Saharan Africa. Under climate change conditions, the devastation is unknown and needs to be investigated and incorporated in future control strategies. Furthermore, the knowledge of the distribution and proximity of other domestic and wild animals to tick infested areas is inadequate and yet is vital to proper management of ticks and tick-borne diseases. This thesis addresses these concerns using a modelling approach in which current, future climate and tick/host distribution data were combined in a GIS environment. Different statistical methods were employed in the analysis of predicted range alterations. A comparison of how different climate data sets predict the current distribution of four Rhipicephalus species revealed different distributions per climate datasets. It is therefore important to assess the suitability of a climate data before use. The current and future prediction of 30 Rhipicephalus species showed that East Africa and South Africa are the most vulnerable regions on the continent to climate-induced changes in tick distributions and tick-borne diseases. More than 50% of the species examined show potential range expansion and more than 70% of this range expansion is found in economically important tick species. There is also an increase in tick species richness in the south-western regions of the sub-continent. More than 20 % of the species experienced range shifts of between 50 and 100 %. The predicted impacts of climate change on the tick-borne disease, East Coast Fever (ECF) showed a potential increase in Northern Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Zambia and eastern DRC. Contraction was the main range alteration predicted for the vertebrate species that act as hosts of R. appendiculatus under climate change conditions. However, more generalist species expanded their ranges. Different tick species reacted differently to predicted climate changes and different areas in Africa experienced varying degrees of impacts. The ability of tick and host species to shift their ranges depends on the degree of land degradation and transformation and the existing ecological interactions. The existing social, economic and environmental policies in individual counties will determine the actual vulnerability.",

         "abstract": "Carbon (C) emissions from wildfires are a key terrestrial\u2013atmosphere interaction that influences global atmospheric composition and climate. Positive feedbacks between climate warming and boreal wildfires are predicted based on top-down controls of fire weather and climate, but C emissions from boreal fires may also depend on bottom-up controls of fuel availability related to edaphic controls and overstory tree composition. Here we synthesized data from 417 field sites spanning six ecoregions in the northwestern North American boreal forest and assessed the network of interactions among potential bottom-up and top-down drivers of C emissions. Our results indicate that C emissions are more strongly driven by fuel availability than by fire weather, highlighting the importance of fine-scale drainage conditions, overstory tree species composition and fuel accumulation rates for predicting total C emissions. By implication, climate change-induced modification of fuels needs to be considered for accurately predicting future C emissions from boreal wildfires.",

The resulting scarcity of water, food and livelihoods could lead to increasingly desperate populations that challenge governments, enhancing the risk of intra- and interstate conflict. Defence establishments and some political scientists view climate change as a potential threat to peace. While the medical literature increasingly recognises climate change as a fundamental health risk, the dimension of climate change-associated conflict has so far received little attention, despite its profound health implications. Many analysts link climate change with a heightened risk of conflict via causal pathways which involve diminishing or changing resource availability. Plausible consequences include: increased frequency of civil conflict in developing countries; terrorism, asymmetric warfare, state failure; and major regional conflicts. The medical understanding of these threats is inadequate, given the scale of health implications. The medical and public health communities have often been reluctant to interpret conflict as a health issue. However, at times, medical workers have proven powerful and effective peace advocates, most notably with regard to nuclear disarmament. The public is more motivated to mitigate climate change when it is framed as a health issue. Improved medical understanding of the association between climate change and conflict could strengthen mitigation efforts and increase cooperation to cope with the climate change that is now inevitable. \\copyright The Royal Society of Medicine.",

Observations and modeling studies indicate trends in wave height over the past decades. Nevertheless, it is currently impossible to discern whether these trends are the result of climate variability or change. The output of an Earth system model (EC-EARTH) produced within phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is used here to force a global Wave Model (WAM) in order to study the response of waves to different climate regimes. A control simulation was run to determine the natural (unforced) model variability. A simplified fingerprint approach was used to calculate positive and negative limits of natural variability for wind speed and significant wave height, which were then compared to different (forced) climate regimes over the historical period (1850?2010) and in the future climate change scenario RCP8.5 (2010?2100). Detectable climate change signals were found in the current decade (2010?20) in the North Atlantic, equatorial Pacific, and Southern Ocean. Until the year 2060, climate change signals are detectable in 60\\% of the global ocean area. The authors show that climate change acts to generate detectable trends in wind speed and significant wave height that exceed the positive and the negative ranges of natural variability in different regions of the ocean. Moreover, in more than 3\\% of the ocean area, the climate change signal is reversible such that trends exceeded both positive and negative limits of natural variability at different points in time. These changes are attributed to local (due to local wind) and remote (due to swell) factors.",

Two recent versions are described: BCC\\_CSM1.1 with coarse resolution (approximately 2.8125Â°Ã2.8125Â°) and BCC\\_CSM1.1(m) with moderate resolution (approximately 1.125Â°Ã1.125Â°). Both versions are fully coupled climate-carbon cycle models that simulate the global terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycles and include dynamic vegetation. Both models well simulate the concentration and temporal evolution of atmospheric CO2 during the 20th century with anthropogenic CO2 emissions prescribed. Simulations using these two versions of the BCC\\_CSM model have been contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase five (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). These simulations are available for use by both national and international communities for investigating global climate change and for future climate projections. Simulations of the 20th century climate using BCC\\_CSM1.1 and BCC\\_CSM1.1(m) are presented and validated, with particular focus on the spatial pattern and seasonal evolution of precipitation and surface air temperature on global and continental scales. Simulations of climate during the last millennium and projections of climate change during the next century are also presented and discussed. Both BCC\\_CSM1.1 and BCC\\_CSM1.1(m) perform well when compared with other CMIP5 models. Preliminary analyses indicate that the higher resolution in BCC\\_CSM1.1(m) improves the simulation of mean climate relative to BCC\\_CSM1.1, particularly on regional scales.",

The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate-change scientists, particularly with respect to malaria and other vector-transmitted human diseases. The result has been the emergence of a crisis discipline, reminiscent of the early phases of conservation biology. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate and disease along with historical and experimental evidence suggest that climate, along with many other factors, can affect infectious diseases in a nonlinear fashion. However, although the globe is significantly warmer than it was a century ago, there is little evidence that climate change has already favored infectious diseases. While initial projections suggested dramatic future increases in the geographic range of infectious diseases, recent models predict range shifts in disease distributions, with little net increase in area. Many factors can affect infectious disease, and some may overshadow the effects of climate.",

Results indicate that the alteration of solar PV supply by the end of this century compared with the estimations made under current climate conditions should be in the range (â14\\%;+2\\%), with the largest decreases in Northern countries. Temporal stability of power generation does not appear as strongly affected in future climate scenarios either, even showing a slight positive trend in Southern countries.

While the BCSA method reproduces the statistical features of the observed fine data, this existing model does not replicate the observed coarse spatial pattern, and subsequently, the cross-correlation between the observed coarse data and downscaled fine data with the model cannot be preserved. To address the dissimilarity between the BCSA downscaled data and observed fine data, a new statistical spatial downscaling method, ``conditional stochastic simulation with bias correction'' (BCCS), which employs the conditional multivariate distribution and principal component analysis, is proposed. Gridded observed climate data of mean daily precipitation (mm/day) covering a month at 1/8Â° for a fine resolution and at 1Â° for a coarse resolution over Florida for the current and future periods were used to verify and cross-validate the proposed technique. The observed coarse and fine data cover the 50-year period from 1950 to1999, and the future RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios cover the 100-year period from 2000 to 2099. The verification and cross-validation results show that the proposed BCCS downscaling method serves as an effective alternative means of downscaling monthly precipitation levels to assess climate change effects on hydrological variables. The RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 GCM scenarios are successfully downscaled.",

         "volume": "3","number": "2","pages": "29-37","abstract": "Climate change has become the dominant topic of discourse among scientists and other stakeholders in climate science in this century. Several researches have been conducted to assess its magnitude, causes, adverse impacts and possible solution to its challenges at various scales where adaptation and mitigation were the fundamental recommendations. While public awareness and perception of the change, are the necessary pre-requisites to achieve true adaptation and mitigation, in the context of sustainable development. However, most of the negotiations were made at international level making it Top-Down affair with little regard to national dynamics of individual countries. The aim of this research was to assess the level of awareness and risk perception of climate change, among rural people in Funtua Local Government Area, Katsina State, Nigeria. A household questionnaire survey method was used in collecting the primary data from 384 randomly selected respondents, in which 97.7 response rate was recorded. Descriptive statistics such as frequency and percentage distribution, mean score and tables were used in analyzing and presenting the data. While Binomial Logistic Regression Analysis was used to ascertain the effect of some socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, on their likelihood of been aware of climate change and perceiving it as a risk. The study revealed that climate change awareness was impressively high 78 of the respondents were aware of it, though with poor knowledge of its causes among the respondents. While majority 73 of the respondents agreed that climate change is a great risk to their individual lives and the society. The study further revealed that, sex, level of educational attainment, and main occupation of the respondents p .005 significantly predicts their level of climate change awareness. But, only level of education and main occupation p .005 significantly predicts risk perception of the adverse change among the respondents. The study then recommended that, the Governments should tailored their climate change policy and programmes, toward educating the rural people, so as to enhance their level of awareness of the scenario for better participation in adaptation and mitigation programmes the Government at both federal and state levels through their relevant agencies, should double their effort in public awareness campaign, especially on causes and the risk associated with climate change to the rural people that, extension agencies should double their efforts in public awareness campaign about climate change and adaptation techniques to especially those engaged in climate-sensitive activities and that further study should be conducted to assess adaptive capacity and adaptation strategies adopted among the rural people.

Here, we derive metrics of narrativity from psychology and literary theory, and use these metrics to test the hypothesis that more narrative climate change writing is more likely to be influential, using citation frequency as a proxy for influence. From a sample of 732 scientific abstracts drawn from the climate change literature, we find that articles with more narrative abstracts are cited more often. This effect is closely associated with journal identity: higher-impact journals tend to feature more narrative articles, and these articles tend to be cited more often. These results suggest that writing in a more narrative style increases the uptake and influence of articles in climate literature, and perhaps in scientific literature more broadly.",

This trend is expected to continue due to solar technologies becoming cheaper and more readily available along with low carbon government legislation such as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) supporting solar energy deployment. However, the effects of climate change on the solar resource remain largely unstudied. Climate change affects cloud cover characteristics and consequently directly affects the performance of solar energy technologies.\n\nThis paper investigates the UK solar irradiation resource for both the present and future climates.\n\nThe present solar irradiation level was assessed through the conversion of 30 years of observed historical monthly average sunshine duration data. The method and results are validated by comparing the converted solar irradiation levels to actual solar irradiance measurements at weather stations with significant historical records of solar irradiance data.\n\nThe impact of climate change is investigated across different regions of the UK by using the UKCP09 probabilistic climate change projections.\n\nWe find that the current average UK annual solar resource is 101.2 Wmâ2, ranging from 128.4 Wmâ2 in the south of England to 71.8 Wmâ2 in the northwest of Scotland. It seems likely that climate change will increase the average resource in the south of the UK, while marginally decreasing it in the Northwest. The overall effect is a mean increase of the UK solar resource, however it will have greater seasonal variability and discrepancies between geographical regions will be reinforced.",

This analysis considers the effect of increased CO2 on near-surface temperatures. A spatial CO2 fingerprint based on control and forced model output from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Climate System Model was developed. The Bayesian approach is distinguished by several new facets. First, the prior model for the amplitude of the fingerprint is a mixture of two distributions: one reflects prior uncertainty in the anticipated value of the amplitude under the hypothesis of \u201Cno climate change.\u201D The second reflects behavior assuming\u201Cclimate change forced by CO2.\u201D Second, within the Bayesian framework, a new formulation of detection and attribution analyses based on practical significance of impacts rather than traditional statistical significance was presented. Third, since Bayesian analyses can be very sensitive to prior inputs, a robust Bayesian approach, which investigates the ranges of posterior inferences as prior inputs are varied, was used. Following presentation of numerical results that enforce the claim of changes in temperature patterns due to anthropogenic CO2 forcing, the article concludes with a comparative analysis for another CO2 fingerprint and selected discussion.",

As predictions from different models often disagree, understanding the sources of this divergence is central to building a more robust picture of climate change's likely impacts. A common approach is to use statistical models trained on historical yields and some simplified measurements of weather, such as growing season average temperature and precipitation. Although the general strengths and weaknesses of statistical models are widely understood, there has been little systematic evaluation of their performance relative to other methods. Here we use a perfect model approach to examine the ability of statistical models to predict yield responses to changes in mean temperature and precipitation, as simulated by a process-based crop model. The CERES-Maize model was first used to simulate historical maize yield variability at nearly 200 sites in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the impacts of hypothetical future scenarios of 2Â°C warming and 20% precipitation reduction. Statistical models of three types (time series, panel, and cross-sectional models) were then trained on the simulated historical variability and used to predict the responses to the future climate changes. The agreement between the process-based and statistical models\u2019 predictions was then assessed as a measure of how well statistical models can capture crop responses to warming or precipitation changes. The performance of statistical models differed by climate variable and spatial scale, with time-series statistical models ably reproducing site-specific yield response to precipitation change, but performing less well for temperature responses. In contrast, statistical models that relied on information from multiple sites, namely panel and cross-sectional models, were better at predicting responses to temperature change than precipitation change. The models based on multiple sites were also much less sensitive to the length of historical period used for training. For all three statistical approaches, the performance improved when individual sites were first aggregated to country-level averages. Results suggest that statistical models, as compared to CERES-Maize, represent a useful if imperfect tool for projecting future yield responses, with their usefulness higher at broader spatial scales. It is also at these broader scales that climate projections are most available and reliable, and therefore statistical models are likely to continue to play an important role in anticipating future impacts of climate change.",

The present European distribution was satisfactorily simulated for 45 species, which showed good statistics of fit between observed species' distributions and derived models. The predicted responses to climate change demonstrate that the distribution of many species in Europe may be affected by climate change, but that the effects are likely to differ between species. The general pattern is of a south-west to north-east shift in suitable climate space, with gains balancing losses for many species. Based on the total change in potential climate space in Europe, the species most sensitive to climate change were Rubus chamaemorus (Cloudberry; negatively affected) and Genista acanthoclada (Hairy greenweed; positively affected). This disparity in species' response has important implications for EU biodiversity policy as the significance of different countries changes in terms of their future contribution to the conservation of habitats and species.",

Climate change may exacerbate species invasions across communities if non-native species are better able to respond to climate changes than native species. Recent evidence indicates that species that respond to climate change by adjusting their phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering) have historically increased in abundance. The extent to which non-native species success is similarly linked to a favorable climate change response, however, remains untested. We analyzed a dataset initiated by the conservationist Henry David Thoreau that documents the long-term phenological response of native and non-native plant species over the last 150 years from Concord, Massachusetts (USA). Our results demonstrate that non-native species, and invasive species in particular, have been far better able to respond to recent climate change by adjusting their flowering time. This demonstrates that climate change has likely played, and may continue to play, an important role in facilitating non-native species naturalization and invasion at the community level.",

Distributions have changed fast and are changing fast in response to many factors, including climatic change. The response time of arable agriculture is intrinsically fast, but perennial crops and especially forests are unlikely to adapt easily. Predictions of many of the variables needed to predict changes in pathogen range are still rather uncertain, and their effects will be profoundly modified by changes elsewhere in the agricultural system, including both economic changes affecting growing systems and hosts and evolutionary changes in pathogens and hosts. Tools to predict changes based on environmental correlations depend on good primary data, which is often absent, and need to be checked against the historical record, which remains very poor for almost all pathogens. We argue that at present the uncertainty in predictions of change is so great that the important adaptive response is to monitor changes and to retain the capacity to innovate, both by access to economic capital with reasonably long-term rates of return and by retaining wide scientific expertise, including currently less fashionable specialisms.",

It explores the language used to discuss adaptation, what is known about resonant frames, drawing on adaptation discourses in policy, practice, and the media. Identifying trends and widely applicable insights is made challenging not only by the variety of words used to speak of adaptation, but by the fact that 'adaptation' language is often not used at all. A broad literature on perceptions and experiences of climate change impacts and how these experiences affect people's valuations and emotional responses to climate change offers crucial insights to the challenges and opportunities in communicating adaptation. It reveals much about people's interest in and acceptability and knowledge of adaptation, about preferred timing and who is thought to be responsible for enacting adaptive actions. Insights from the literature on place attachment and place identity are of particular relevance to public engagement on adaptation as it goes a long way toward explaining the quality of the adaptation debate to date while offering promising opportunities for dialogue. Suggestions for improved adaptation communication practice and critical research gaps are offered. For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.

Niches of climate change contrarianism: Columnists in conservative news outlets. High salience for contrarians in the US and the UK, but contextualized as fringe voices in the scientific debate. Journalists individual attitudes towards climate change are reflected in their articles. Move from 'objective' to interpretive climate journalism. This study explores two pre-eminent features of transnational media coverage of climate change: The framing of climate change as a harmful, human-induced risk and the way that reporting handles contrarian voices in the climate debate. The analysis shows how journalists, and their interpretations and professional norms, shape media debates about climate change. The study links an analysis of media content to a survey of the authors of the respective articles. It covers leading print and online news outlets in Germany, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Switzerland. It finds that climate journalism has moved beyond the norm of balance towards a more interpretive pattern of journalism. Quoting contrarian voices still is part of transnational climate coverage, but these quotes are contextualized with a dismissal of climate change denial. Yet niches of denial persist in certain contexts, and much journalistic attention is focused on the narrative of 'warners vs. deniers,' and overlooks the more relevant debates about climate change.",

While previous studies have evaluated a range of impacts and adaptation of climate change (CC) on crop yield, few studies have focused on evaluating the effectiveness of changing cultivars with different vernalization requirements as an adaptation. In the present study, mean and inter-annual variability of yield were quantified for three winter wheat cultivar types at three ecological sites (Shangzhuang in Beijing, Quzhou in Hebei and Huangfanqu in Henan) in the North China Plain, by linking a crop model and the outputs of Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) for both the baseline (1961\u201390) and future SRES scenarios A2 and B2 (2070\u20132100). The results showed that a warming trend prolonged the length of the vegetative growth period of local cultivars through reduced vernalization, generally leading to a negative impact on yield. However, the introduction of cultivars with relatively lower vernalization demands from warmer southern to cooler northern regions could be an effective adaptation strategy to offset the negative impact of climatic change. Adjustment in cultivars increased yield at Shangzhuang and maintained it at Quzhou and Huangfanqu. Elevated CO2 would significantly increase yield in the future with or without considering the sensitivities of the selected cultivars. The inter-annual variability of yield generally increased in the A2 scenario, but decreased in the B2 scenario. Overall, winter wheat with semi-winter types or weak-winter types would grow preferentially, while cultivars with winter types would probably be reduced in future.",

         "abstract": "Non-government organisations (NGOs) make up an important component of social movements. Environmental issues are currently a dominant theme for NGOs in Australia, where environmental NGOs play an important role in raising the need for policy action on climate change. Climate policy in Australia is considered to be inadequate by many NGOs, and this suggests they have not fulfilled their aim of influencing effective policy action on climate change. Although there is an increasing analytical focus on the \u2018third sector \u2019 which encompasses NGOs, academic or other literature, research that analyses and critiques specific NGO campaigns with relevance to climate change is somewhat limited. This paper canvasses a range of social movement literature to identify theories and explanations that illuminate both the obstacles and opportunities facing contemporary NGO climate change campaigns. The most relevant theories relate to the school of new social movements on values and paradigms, incrementalism, pressure groups, discourse, organizations, and the Movement Action Plan. These add to academic understanding of the ability of social movements to direct political attention and community concern to environmental issues, and could contribute to advising directions for climate change campaigns by environmental NGOs in Australia",

Future European wind energetic resource can increase in the Baltic Sea. Future European wind energetic resource can decrease in Southern Europe. Intra-annual variability can increase/decrease in the Baltic Sea/Southern Europe. Changes are higher under stronger radiative forcing and by the end of the 21st century. Climate change impact on future European large-scale wind energy resource under the latest IPCC CMIP5 future climate projections were analysed. After assessing the models that best reproduce contemporary near-surface wind speeds over Europe, their data was used to assess future changes in the wind energetic resource in Europe. Using a multi-model ensemble composed by the models that showed the best ability to represent contemporary near-surface wind speeds over Europe, the future European large-scale wind energetic resource is projected to increase in Northern-Central Europe (Baltic Sea and surrounding areas), and decrease in the Mediterranean region, mainly by the end of the current century and under stronger radiative forcing scenarios. It is also projected an increase of the intra-annual variability in the Baltic Sea and surrounding areas and a decrease in Mediterranean areas, but no significant changes in the inter-annual variability are expected over Europe. Despite the large uncertainty associated to future climate projections, the findings of this work can serve as background for future downscaling of CMIP5 data to regional-local scales focused on climate change impacts on wind energy, and should be seen as a preliminary warning that a continuous increase of greenhouse gases emissions are expected to impact European wind energy production.",

These are substantially lower than HadGEM2-ES (TCR: 2.5 K; ECS: 4.6 K) arising from a combination of changes in the size of climate feedbacks. While the change in the net cloud feedback between HadGEM3 and HadGEM2 is relatively small, there is a change in sign of its longwave and a strengthening of its shortwave components. At a global scale, there is little impact of the increase in atmospheric resolution on the future climate change signal and even at a broad regional scale, many features are robust including tropical rainfall changes, however, there are some significant exceptions. For the North Atlantic and western Europe, the tripolar pattern of winter storm changes found in most CMIP5 models is little impacted by resolution but for the most intense storms, there is a larger percentage increase in number at higher resolution than at lower resolution. Arctic sea-ice sensitivity shows a larger dependence on resolution than on atmospheric physics.",

We used both niche-based models (NBM) to evaluate the sensitivity of 159 endemic species to climate change (of an original 1020 plant species modeled) and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning. Endemic species modeled by NBM are moderately sensitive to projected climate change. Fewer than 5% are predicted to experience complete range loss by 2080, although more than 47% of the species are expected to be vulnerable (range reduction &gt;30%) by 2080 if they are assumed unable to migrate. Disaggregation of results by life-form showed distinct patterns. Endemic species of perennial herb, geophyte and tree life-formsare predicted to be negatively impacted in Namibia, whereas annual herb and succulent endemic species remain relatively stable by 2050 and 2080. Endemic annual herb species are even predicted to extend their range north-eastward into the tree and shrub savanna with migration, and tolerance of novel substrates. The current protected area network is predicted to meet its mandate by protecting most of the current endemicity in Namibia into the future. Vegetation simulated by DGVM is projected to experience a reduction in cover, net primary productivity and leaf area index throughout much of the country by 2050, with important implications for the faunal component of Namibia's ecosystems, and the agricultural sector. The plant functional type (PFT) composition of the major biomes may be substantially affected by climate change and rising atmospheric CO22013 currently widespread deciduous broad leaved trees and C4 PFTs decline, with the C4 PFT particularly negatively affected by rising atmospheric CO2 impacts by 223C2080 and deciduous broad leaved trees more likely directly impacted by drying and warming. The C3 PFT may increase in prominence in the northwestern quadrant of the country by 223C2080 as CO2 concentrations increase. These results suggest that substantial changes in species diversity, vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning can be expected in Namibia with anticipated climate change, although endemic plant richness may persist in the topographically diverse central escarpment region.",

However, AGF may cause outbreeding depression (especially if source and recipient populations have been long isolated) and may disrupt local adaptation to nonclimatic factors. Selection should eliminate extrinsic outbreeding depression due to adaptive differences in large populations, and simulations suggest that, within a few generations, evolution should resolve mild intrinsic outbreeding depression due to epistasis. To weigh the risks of AGF against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow. AGF should be a powerful tool for managing foundation and resource-producing species with large populations and broad ranges that show signs of historical adaptation to local climatic conditions.",

Here we describe projections of climate change in Australian waters and examine from the literature likely impacts of these changes on Australian marine biodiversity. For the Australian region, climate model simulations project oceanic warming, an increase in ocean stratification and decrease in mixing depth, a strengthening of the East Australian Current, increased ocean acidification, a rise in sea level, alterations in cloud cover and ozone levels altering the levels of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface, and altered storm and rainfall regimes. Evidence of climate change impacts on biological systems are generally scarce in Australia compared to the Northern Hemisphere. The poor observational records in Australia are attributed to a lack of studies of climate impacts on natural systems and species at regional or national scales. However, there are notable exceptions such as widespread bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef and poleward shifts in temperate fish populations. Biological changes are likely to be considerable and to have economic and broad ecological consequences, especially in climate-change 'hot spots' such as the Tasman Sea and the Great Barrier Reef.",

Integration of climate change, electricity sources and AC (air conditioner) prevalence. Final relative ranked susceptibility index of the included countries. Sensitivity analysis reveals importance of each factor. The electricity system is particularly susceptible to climate change due to the close interconnectedness between electricity production, consumption and climate. This study provides a country based relative analysis of 21 European countries' electricity system susceptibility to climate change. Taking into account 14 quantitative influencing factors, the susceptibility of each country is examined both for the current and projected system with the result being a relative ranked index. Luxembourg and Greece are the most susceptible relatively due in part to their inability to meet their own electricity consumption demand with inland production, and the fact that the majority of their production is from more susceptible sources, primarily combustible fuels. Greece experiences relatively warm mean temperatures, which are expected to increase in the future leading to greater summer electricity consumption, increasing susceptibility. Norway was found to be the least susceptible, relatively, due to its consistent production surplus, which is primarily from hydro (a less susceptible source) and a likely decrease of winter electricity consumption as temperatures rise due to climate change. The findings of this study enable countries to identify the main factors that increase their electricity system susceptibility and proceed with adaptation measures that are the most effective in decreasing susceptibility.",

In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land-use and energy experts, land-use and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life-cycle assessment experts. We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-the-art knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100Â EJ: high agreement; 100\u2013300Â EJ: medium agreement; above 300Â EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245Â EJÂ yrâ1 to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large-scale deployment (>200Â EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2Â° degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land-intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts. We conclude that the high variability in pathways, uncertainties in technological development and ambiguity in political decision render forecasts on deployment levels and climate effects very difficult. However, uncertainty about projections should not preclude pursuing beneficial bioenergy options.",

As a result, scientific interest is rapidly shifting from detection and attribution of global climate change to prediction of its impacts at the regional scale. However, nearly everything we have any confidence in when it comes to climate change is related to global patterns of surface temperature, which are primarily controlled by thermodynamics. In contrast, we have much less confidence in atmospheric circulation aspects of climate change, which are primarily controlled by dynamics and exert a strong control on regional climate. Model projections of circulation-related fields, including precipitation, show a wide range of possible outcomes, even on centennial timescales. Sources of uncertainty include low-frequency chaotic variability and the sensitivity to model error of the circulation response to climate forcing. As the circulation response to external forcing appears to project strongly onto existing patterns of variability, knowledge of errors in the dynamics of variability may provide some constraints on model projections. Nevertheless, higher scientific confidence in circulation-related aspects of climate change will be difficult to obtain. For effective decision-making, it is necessary to move to a more explicitly probabilistic, risk-based approach.",

Social marketing approaches are becoming increasingly popular among governmental and non-governmental actors seeking to engage the public on climate change. The effectiveness of social marketing in achieving specific behavioural goals is empirically well-supported. However, in the first systematic critique of social marketing as a strategy for engaging the public on climate change, we present evidence that social marketing alone is insufficient to build support for the more ambitious policy changes and interventions that constitute a proportional response to climate change. In some circumstances, social marketing approaches may even be counterproductive. We describe some alternative approaches for engaging the public, which may provide governmental and non-governmental actors with additional or preferable tools for promoting public engagement with climate change. Given the scale of the challenge, it seems critical that those seeking to engage the public are equipped with the most effective strategies available \u2013 a goal that this paper seeks to contribute to. We conclude that acknowledging the limitations of social marketing \u2013 and exploring alternative methods of engaging the public \u2013 is an urgent task for climate change communication researchers and practitioners.

Few global-scale assessments have been carried out, and these are limited in their ability to capture the uncertainty in climate projections, and omit potentially important aspects such as extreme events and changes in pests and diseases. There is a lack of clarity on how climate change impacts on drought are best quantified from an agricultural perspective, with different metrics giving very different impressions of future risk. The dependence of some regional agriculture on remote rainfall, snowmelt and glaciers adds to the complexity. Indirect impacts via sea-level rise, storms and diseases have not been quantified. Perhaps most seriously, there is high uncertainty in the extent to which the direct effects of CO2 rise on plant physiology will interact with climate change in affecting productivity. At present, the aggregate impacts of climate change on global-scale agricultural productivity cannot be reliably quantified.",

We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species\u2019 range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation. Synthesis This article seeks synthesis across the fields of dispersal ecology and evolution, species distribution modelling and conservation biology. Increasing effort focuses on understanding how dispersal influences species' responses to climate change. Importantly, though perhaps not broadly widely-recognised, species' dispersal characteristics are themselves likely to alter during rapid climate change. We compile evidence for direct and indirect influences that climate change may have on dispersal, some ecological and others evolutionary. We emphasise the need for predictive modelling to account for this dispersal realism and highlight the need for conservation to make better use of our existing knowledge related to dispersal.",

The main independent variables of interest are temperature and relative humidity covering a period of eight years 2010 2017. Data of in and out patients diagnosed with psychiatric cases were sourced from the from the hospital records. The population of the study is 53616 numbers of patients, comprising of 25160 male and 28456 female patients that visited the hospital from the year within the years of study. Data collected were analyzed with used of single regression and multivariate regression analysis using STATA Software. The study found that climate parameters temperature and relative humidity as a separate variables and the overlapping effect of the two independent increases the vulnerability of male and female patients to the risk of psychiatric cases and increases the numbers of patient visiting the hospital. There were positive associations between the numbers of male female patient and the two parameters as well as between the overlapping effects. Male population are more vulnerable to the risks of psychiatric cases as temperature increase while female population were more vulnerable to the risks of psychiatric cases as relative humidity increases. The impact of the overlapping resultant effects of the two independent variables is more on the male than the female that were visiting the hospital. Male populations were generally more vulnerable to the risks of psychiatric cases than female as the metabolic rate and brain volume increases with temperature. The vulnerability of male and female population to psychiatric cases was not equally distributed throughout the period of study. Male and female population respond differently to the impact of each parameter throughout those years considered and these are considered to be psychological and physiological factor differences in male and female. Out of a total 53616 numbers patients that visited the hospital between 2010 2017 , only 21.28 11,409 are male patients that were diagnosed with psychiatric cases and all together traceable attributed to increased temperature, relative humidity and overlapping effect escalation while only 20.02 10,736 was female that were diagnosed with psychiatric cases and all together traceable attributed to the increased temperature, relative humidity and overlapping effect escalation. In the overall analysis male population were more vulnerable to the risk of psychiatric cases than female as the two independent variables increases. The effective strength of temperature made the numbers of male female populations more vulnerable to the risk of psychiatric cases than the effective strength of relative humidity. Jaiyeola O.

Among the numerous strategies to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions is to decommission carbon intensive electricity production while increase the deployment of renewable energy technologies \u2013 such as wind and solar power generation. Yet the generation capacity, availability, and intermittency of these renewable energy sources are strongly climate dependent \u2013 and may also shift due to unavoidable human-induced change. In this study, we present a method, based on previous studies, that estimates the risk of climate-change on wind and solar resource potential. The assessment combines the risk-based climate projections from the Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM), which considers emissions and global climate sensitivity uncertainty, with more regionally detailed climate information from 8 GCMs available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP-3). Southern Africa, specifically those in the Southern African Development Countries (SADC), is used as a case study. We find a median change close to zero by 2050 in the long-term mean of both wind speed and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), both used as indicators of changes in electricity production potential. Although the extreme possibilities range from about â15\\% to +15\\% change, these are associated with low probability. The most prominent effect of a modest climate mitigation policy is seen in the doubled likelihood of the mode of the distribution of wind power change. This increased likelihood is made at the expense of decreased likelihood in the large changes of the distribution, but these trade-offs with the more extreme likelihoods are not symmetric with respect to the modal change.",

For each forcing-scenario, the three climate models' projections were combined to estimate the multi-model mean projection of climate change. The relative importance of the variability in the projected wave heights that is due to the forcing prescribed in a forcing-scenario was assessed on the basis of ensemble simulations conducted with the Canadian coupled climate model CGCM2. The uncertainties in the projections of wave heights that are due to differences among the climate models and/or among the forcing-scenarios were characterized. The results show that the multi-model mean projection of climate change has patterns similar to those derived from using the CGCM2 projections alone, but the magnitudes of changes are generally smaller in the boreal oceans but larger in the region nearby the Antarctic coastal zone. The forcing-induced variance (as simulated by CGCM2) was identified to be of substantial magnitude in some areas in all seasons. The uncertainty due to differences among the forcing-scenarios is much smaller than that due to differences among the climate models, although it was identified to be statistically significant in most areas of the oceans (this indicates that different forcing conditions do make notable differences in the wave height climate change projection). The sum of the model and forcing-scenario uncertainties is smaller in the JFM and AMJ seasons than in other seasons, and it is generally small in the mid-high latitudes and large in the tropics. In particular, some areas in the northern oceans were projected to have large changes by all the three climate models.",

As many species are unlikely to migrate fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic diversity within populations.",

Mitigation faces collective action issues because its costs are focused on specific locations/actors but benefits are global and nonexcludable. Adaptation, in contrast, creates local benefits, and therefore should face fewer collective action issues. However, governance units vary in the types of adaptation policies they adopt. To explain this variation, we suggest conceptualizing adaptation-as-politics because adaptation speaks to the issues of power, conflicting policy preferences, resource allocation, and administrative tensions. In examining who develops and implements adaptation, we explore whether adaptation is the old wine of disaster management in the new bottle of climate policy, and the tensions between national and local policy making. In exploring what adaptation policies are adopted, we discuss maladaptation and the distinction between hard and soft infrastructure. Finally, we examine why politicians favor visible, hard adaptation over soft adaptation, and how international influences shape local policy.",

With deforestation activities providing a source of ignition, the combination of this with increased fire risk could lead to widespread impacts on Amazonian ecosystems. This would also contribute further to climate change through feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. This study uses the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index and an ensemble of variants of the HadCM3 climate model to simulate potential changes to fire risk in Amazonia over the 21st century. Significant increases in central and eastern Amazonia are simulated by 2020, and high fire danger for over 50\\% of the forest is simulated in all model runs by 2080. By 2080, as much as 25\\% of Amazonia shows high levels of agreement in projections of combined fire risk and deforestation. The areas simulated with high fire danger are also those projected to be impacted most significantly by deforestation. If the regional climate changes simulated for Amazonia by HadCM3 are realistic, the risk of significant forest damage could become high, and deforestation activities could, therefore, have a greater potential for impacting on wider areas of forest.",

These, in turn, are likely to have had, and will continue to have, impacts on human health. While such impacts have received increasing attention in recent years, the impacts of climate change on aeroallergens and related allergic diseases have been somewhat neglected. Despite this, a number of studies have revealed potential impacts of climate change on aeroallergens that may have enormous clinical and public health significance. The purpose of this review is to synthesize this work and to outline a number of research challenges in this area. There is now considerable evidence to suggest that climate change will have, and has already had, impacts on aeroallergens. These include impacts on pollen amount, pollen allergenicity, pollen season, plant and pollen distribution, and other plant attributes. There is also some evidence of impacts on other aeroallergens, such as mould spores. There are many research challenges along the road to a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change on aeroallergens and allergic diseases such as asthma and hayfever. It is important that public health authorities and allergy practitioners be aware of these changes in the environment, and that research scientists embrace the challenges that face further work in this area.",

The utilization of renewable resources, however, highly depends on the climate conditions, which may be impacted in the future due to global climate change. Based on literature analysis, this paper presents a general framework for renewable energy vulnerability assessment and applies grey cluster analysis method to demonstrate the features of vulnerability, and then employs the Simple Additive Weighting Approach to address the multiple-attribute decision problems of vulnerability assessment in China. The categorized results imply that the proposed index system is suitable for decision-making analysis and comparative analysis of renewable energy vulnerability to climate change in China. In terms of exposure part, the cluster results are complex and varied due to the unique combination of natural factors, social factors and the energy structure. In the sensitivity section, the results are presented on the distribution of areas rich in hydropower, wind power and solar energy potential. Moreover, the main results of this study are the higher renewable energy vulnerability of the poorer regions of China to climate change and the relative higher importance of adaptive capacity building in vulnerability management. Finally, policy recommendations on regional renewable energy vulnerability management are also made.",

However, several regional climate impacts depend on the atmospheric circulation, whose response to climate change remains substantially uncertain and not interpretable in a probabilistic sense in multimodel ensemble projections. To account for these uncertainties, a novel approach where regional climate change is analyzed as a function of carbon emissions conditional on plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation change is here presented and applied to the CMIP5 models? future projections. The different storylines are determined based on the response in three remote drivers of regional circulation: the tropical and polar amplification of global warming and changes in stratospheric vortex strength. As an illustration of this approach, it is shown that the severity of the projected wintertime Mediterranean precipitation decline and central European windiness increase strongly depends on the storyline of circulation change. For a given magnitude of global warming, the highest impact storyline for these aspects of European climate is found for a high tropical amplification and a strengthening of the vortex. The difference in the precipitation and wind responses between the storylines is substantial and equivalent to the contribution from several degrees of global warming. Improving the understanding of the remote driver responses is thus needed to better bound the projected regional impacts in the European sector. The value of these storylines to represent the uncertainty in regional climate projections and to inform the selection of CMIP5 models in regional climate impact studies is discussed.",

The nine regional models inherit much of the circulation biases from their host model, especially in winter. In summer, the regional models show a larger spread in circulation statistics, depending on nesting procedures and other model characteristics. Simulated circulation biases appear to have a significant inluence on simulated temperature and precipitation. The PRUDENCE ensemble appears to be biased towards warmer and wetter than observed circulations in winter, and towards warmer and dryer circulations in summer. A2-scenario simulations show important circulation changes, which have a significant impact on changes in the distributions of monthly mean temperature and precipitation. It is likely that interactions between land\u2013surface processes and atmospheric circulation play an important role in the simulated changes in the summer climate in Central Europe.",

The effects of climate change on grain production of a winter wheat\u2013summer maize cropping system were investigated, corresponding to the temperature rising 2 and 5Â°C, precipitation increasing and decreasing by 15% and 30%, and atmospheric CO2 enriching to 500 and 700ppmv. The study focused on two typical counties in the Huang-Huai-Hai (3H) Plain (covering most of the North China Plain), Botou in the north and Huaiyuan in the south, considering irrigated and rain-fed conditions, respectively. Climate change scenarios, derived from available ensemble outputs from general circulation models and the historical trend from 1996 to 2004, were used as atmospheric forcing to a bio-geo-physically process-based dynamic crop model, Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP). VIP simulates full coupling between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and other energy and water transfer processes. The projected crop yields are significantly different from the baseline yield, with the minimum, mean (Â±standardized deviation, SD) and maximum changes being â46%, â10.3Â±20.3%, and 49%, respectively. The overall yield reduction of â18.5Â±22.8% for a 5Â°C increase is significantly greater than â2.3Â±13.2% for a 2Â°C increase. The negative effect of temperature rise on crop yield is partially mitigated by CO2 fertilization. The response of a C3 crop (wheat) to the temperature rise is significantly more sensitive to CO2 fertilization and less negative than the response of C4 (maize), implying a challenge to the present double wheat\u2013maize systems. Increased precipitation significantly mitigated the loss and increased the projected gain of crop yield. Conversely, decreased precipitation significantly exacerbated the loss and reduced the projected gain of crop yield. Irrigation helps to mitigate the decreased crop yield, but CO2 enrichment blurs the role of irrigation. The crops in the wetter southern 3H Plain (Huaiyuan) are significantly more sensitive to climate change than crops in the drier north (Botou). Thus CO2 fertilization effects might be greater under drier conditions. The study provides suggestions for climate change adaptation and sound water resources management in the 3H Plain.",

Office. The report describes how the climate of the United Kingdom may change during the next 100 years. In this description, we take into account natural climate variations as well as a range of future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and different assumed sensitivities of the climate system to these emissions. The resulting climate scenarios are referred to as the UKCIP98 climate scenarios and follow from earlier studies that were published in 1991 and 1996 by the Climate Change Impacts Review Group of the, then, Department of the Environment. These earlier CCIRG91 and CCIRG96 climate scenarios for the UK have been widely used in climate impacts assessments in the UK. The scenarios described here replace these earlier efforts.",

Such models are a special case of species distribution models in which the current geographical distribution of species is related to climatic variables so to enable projections of distributions under future climate change scenarios. This work reviews a number of critical methodological issues that may lead to uncertainty in predictions from bioclimatic modelling. Particular attention is paid to recent developments of bioclimatic modelling that address some of these issues as well as to the topics where more progress needs to be made. Developing and applying bioclimatic models in a informative way requires good understanding of a wide range of methodologies, including the choice of modelling technique, model validation, collinearity, autocorrelation, biased sampling of explanatory variables, scaling and impacts of non-climatic factors. A key challenge for future research is integrating factors such as land cover, direct CO2 effects, biotic interactions and dispersal mechanisms into species-climate models. We conclude that, although bioclimatic envelope models have a number of important advantages, they need to be applied only when users of models have a thorough understanding of their limitations and uncertainties.",

The main independent variables of interest are temperature and relative humidity as climate the two parameters covering a period of eight years 2010 2017. Data of in and out patients diagnosed with epilepsy and other related cases were sourced from the hospital records. The population of the study is 2873 epilepsy patients that visited the hospital within the period of study, comprising of 143 4.98 age 0 4 years, 447 15.56 age 5 9 years, 963 33.52 age 10 19 years, 983 34.22 age 20 44 years, 273 9.50 age 45 64 years, 36 1.25 age 65 69 years and 28 0.97 age 70 years. And for the purpose of analysis and discussion the population of study was further stratified into Children aged 0 19 years 1553 54.05 , adult aged 20 64 years 1256 43.72 , older adult aged 65 69 years 36 1.25 and elderly aged 70 28 0.97 . Data collected were analyzed with the use of single regression Analysis. The study found climate parameters temperature and relative humidity make population vulnerable to the risk of epilepsy cases and therefore increases their visits to the hospital. There are positive associations between the number of epilepsy patients in the Neuropsychiatric Akure and the increase in the two climate two parameters i.e. temperature and relative humidity . Children aged population are more vulnerable to the risk of epilepsy mental ill health as temperature increases while adult aged population are more vulnerable to the risk of epilepsy mental ill health as relative humidity increases. Among children aged, the age group 10 19 years emerged to be more vulnerable to the risk of epilepsy with increase in temperature while age group 20 44 years among the adult aged emerged to more vulnerable to the risk of epilepsy as relative humidity increases. Generally, Epilepsy developed more in those adults than the children when sum the contributions from the two parameters. The vulnerability of various age groups population to epilepsy cases was not equally distributed throughout the year 2010 2017 and this is an indication that different age groups responded differently to the effects of temperature and relative humidity variability.. The effective strength of relative humidity is on the children and adult aged than others group i.e. older adults and elderly , but more on the adult aged while the effective strength of temperature is seen more on the children aged than others group i.e. Adults, older adults and elderly Jaiyeola O.

There has been an increase in carbon dioxide and other trace gases since the Industrial Revolution, largely as a result of man's activities, increasing the radiative heating of the troposphere and surface by about 2 W mâ2. This heating is likely to be enhanced by resulting changes in water vapor, snow and sea ice, and cloud. The associated equilibrium temperature rise is estimated to be between 1 and 2 K, there being uncertainties in the strength of climate feedbacks, particularly those due to cloud. The large thermal inertia of the oceans will slow the rate of warming, so that the expected temperature rise will be smaller than the equilibrium rise. This increases the uncertainty in the expected warming to date, with estimates ranging from less than 0.5 K to over 1 K. The observed increase of 0.5 K since 1900 is consistent with the lower range of these estimates, but the variability in the observed record is such that one cannot necessarily conclude that the observed temperature change is due to increases in trace gases. The prediction of changes in temperature over the next 50 years depends on assumptions concerning future changes in trace gas concentrations, the sensitivity of climate, and the effective thermal inertia of the oceans. On the basis of our current understanding a further warming of at least 1 K seems likely. Numerical models of climate indicate that the changes will not be uniform, nor will they be confined to temperature. The simulated warming is largest in high latitudes in winter and smallest over sea ice in summer, with little seasonal variation in the tropics. Annual mean precipitation and runoff increase in high latitudes, and most simulations indicate a drier land surface in northern mid-latitudes in summer. The agreement between different models is much better for temperature than for changes in the hydrological cycle. Priorities for future research include developing an improved representation of cloud in numerical models, obtaining a better understanding of vertical mixing in the deep ocean, and determining the inherent variability of the ocean-atmosphere system. Progress in these areas should enable detection of a man-made  \u201D greenhouse\u201D warming within the next two decades.",

It can be hypothesized that species with different kinds of distributions in environmental niche and geographical space may respond differently to changes in climate. Here, we compare projections of shifts in species ranges with simple descriptors of species niche (position and breadth) and geographical (range size) distributions.Location Europe.Methods The future distribution for 1200 European plant species were predicted by niche-based models using seven climate variables known to have an important role in limiting plant species distributions. Ecological niche properties were estimated using a multivariate analysis. Species range changes were then related to species niche properties using generalized linear models.Results Generally, percentage of remaining suitable habitat in the future increased linearly with niche position and breadth. Increases in potential suitable habitat were associated with greater range size, and had a hump-shaped relationship with niche position on temperature gradient. By relating species chorotypes to percentage of remaining or gained habitat, we highlighted biogeographical patterns of species sensitivity to climate change. These were clearly related to the degree of exposure according to regional patterns of projected climate change.Main conclusion This study highlights general patterns about the relationships between sensitivity of species to climate change and their ecological properties. There is a strong convergence between simple inferences based on ecological characteristics of species and projections by bioclimatic 'envelope' models, confirming macroecological assumptions about species sensitivity based on niche properties. These patterns appear to be most strongly driven by the exposure of species to climate change, with additional effects of species niche characteristics. We conclude that simple species niche properties are powerful indicators of species' sensitivity to climate change.",

We apply the region-of-influence method as a pooling scheme when estimating distributions of extremes, which consists in incorporating data from a \u2018region\u2019 (set of gridboxes) when fitting an extreme value distribution in any single gridbox. The method reduces random variations in the estimates of parameters of the extreme value distribution that result from large spatial variability of heavy precipitation. Although spatial patterns differ among the models, most RCMs simulate increases in high quantiles of precipitation amounts when averaged over the area for the late-twenty-first century (2070\u20132099) climate in both winter and summer. The sign as well as the magnitude of the projected change vary only little for individual parts of the distribution of daily precipitation in winter. In summer, on the other hand, the projected changes increase with the quantile of the distribution in all RCMs, and they are negative (positive) for parts of the distribution below (above) the 98% quantile if averaged over the RCMs. The increases in precipitation extremes in summer are projected in spite of a pronounced drying in most RCMs. Although a rather general qualitative agreement of the models concerning the projected changes of precipitation extremes is found in both winter and summer, the uncertainties in climate change scenarios remain large and would likely further increase considerably if a more complete ensemble of RCM simulations driven by a larger suite of global models and with a range of possible scenarios of the radiative forcing is available.",

Over recent decades, climate change-related alterations in crop phenology have been observed and reported for various global crops. However, attributing changes in crop phenology to climate change is difficult, because there have been concurrent changes in crop management. In this paper, we isolated and quantified the impacts of climate change and crop management on the changes of wheat phenology in China, during the period 1981\u20132010, using a first-difference multiple regression model. Our results shows: (1) based on observed phenological data, in spring/winter wheat, the mean sowing and emergence date were delayed by 0.91/2.29 and 0.39/0.73days decadeâ1; mean anthesis and maturity date advanced by 1.05/2.28 and 0.01/1.42days decadeâ1; mean length of vegetative growth period (VGP) and whole growth period (WGP) were shortened by 1.09/2.86 and 0.89/3.69days decadeâ1; mean length of reproductive growth period (RGP) was prolonged by 0.55/0.61days decadeâ1. (2) At most stations, changing direction of wheat phenology affected by isolated impacts of climate change or crop management was consistent with that affected by combined impacts of climate change and crop management. (3) For observed trends of most phenological stages and growth periods, relative contribution from climate change was smaller than from crop management, and average temperature contributed the most among the three contributors (average temperature, cumulative precipitation, and cumulative sunshine hours) to isolated impacts of climate change on wheat phenology. (4) Crop management over the three decades was shown to have helped reduce the lengths of VGP and WGP, but increase the length of RGP for both spring and winter wheat, implying that shorter-duration varieties with a higher yield or better yield stability in changing climate might have been introduced by farmers.",

CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study.",

In this study, we used the projections derived from four global gridded crop models (GGCropMs) to assess the effects of future climate change on the yields of the major crops (i.e., maize, rice, soybean and wheat) in China. The GGCropMs were forced with the bias-corrected climate data from five global climate models (GCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which were made available through the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). The results show that the potential yields of the crops would decrease in the 21st century without carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect. With the CO2 effect, the potential yields of rice and soybean would increase, while the potential yields of maize and wheat would decrease. The uncertainty in yields resulting from the GGCropMs is larger than the uncertainty derived from GCMs in the greater part of China. Climate change may benefit rice and soybean yields in high-altitude and cold regions which are not in the current main agricultural area. However, the potential yields of maize, soybean and wheat may decrease in the major food production area. Development of new agronomic management strategies may be useful for coping with climate change in the areas with a high risk of yield reduction.",

Migrants are key components of biological systems in high latitude regions, where the speed and magnitude of climate change impacts are greatest. They also rely on highly productive seasonal habitats, including wetlands and ocean upwellings that, with climate change, may become less food-rich and predictable in space and time. While migrants are adapted to adjust their behaviour with annual changes in the weather, the decoupling of climatic variables between geographically separate breeding and non-breeding grounds is beginning to result in mistimed migration. Furthermore, human land-use and activity patterns will constrain the ability of many species to modify their migratory routes and may increase the stress induced by climate change. Adapting conservation strategies for migrants in the light of climate change will require substantial shifts in site designation policies, flexibility of management strategies and the integration of forward planning for both people and wildlife. While adaptation to changes may be feasible for some terrestrial systems, wildlife in the marine ecosystem may be more dependent on the degree of climate change mitigation that is achievable.\n\nKEY WORDS: Birds Â· Marine mammals Â· Turtles Â· Fish Â· Phenology Â· Population change Â· Conservation",

Predictions routinely focus on the direct effects of climate change on individual species, yet interactions between species can strongly influence how climate change affects organisms at every scale by altering their individual fitness, geographic ranges and the structure and dynamics of their community. Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change. We propose a framework based on ideas from global-change biology, community ecology, and invasion biology that uses community modules to assess how species interactions shape responses to climate change.",

Under both scenarios, with a few exceptions, the effects on national economic welfare are found to be quite modest. However, prices of agricultural commodities are estimated to rise considerably under the more pessimistic scenario.

The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have increased significantly since the start of the Industrial Era around 1750, with much of this increase occurring over just the last 50 years or so. This is resulting in warming of the climate system as well as changes in precipitation and weather and climate extremes. These changes in climate are having wide-ranging impacts on the Earth's physical, biological and human systems, including human health. It is these impacts of climate change on human health that are the focus of this paper, particularly the impacts on allergens and allergic diseases. Such impacts are particularly significant in many countries where the prevalence of such diseases is high and/or increasing. There is now compelling evidence that rising air temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations are, in some plant species, resulting in increased pollen production and allergenicity and advancement and lengthening of the pollen season. Changes in extreme events, such as thunderstorms and tropical cyclones, will also have impacts on allergic diseases, with, for example, the flooding associated with tropical cyclones leading to proliferation of mould growth in damp homes. The article also considers a range of responses to these health threats, including greenhouse gas mitigation, and adaptation strategies, such as enhanced environmental monitoring and health surveillance and adequate planning for the future medical workforce.",

These are followed by the core chapters, which assess the literature on present day and future climate change impacts on systems, sectors and regions, vulnerabilities to these impacts, and strategies for adaptation. Chapters 17 and 18 consider possible responses through adaptation and the synergies with mitigation. The two final chapters look at key vulnerabilities, and the interrelationships between climate change and sustainability. Chapters 9 to 16 of the Working Group II Fourth Assessment consider regional climate change impacts.",

There is no a priori reason, however, to expect tick abundance or seasonal activity patterns to respond to climate change in ways that inevitably increase the risk of infection by the transmitted pathogens. Changing host availability may be more important than climate in determining tick abundance. The credibility of any (inherently untestable) predictions of future system-specific changes will be strengthened if based on satisfactory explanations of the past. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Europe is presented as a case study: observed patterns of climate change are too similar within and between countries to provide the sole explanation for the extreme spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the marked upsurges in TBE incidence over the past two decades. Instead, a nexus of interacting factors affecting both the risk of infection and exposure of humans to that risk, and each differing in force in space and time, is a more powerful model. Many of these factors are driven by socio-economic changes, and include climate, land cover, wildlife, agricultural practices, industrial activities, (un)employment and income. The same principle may apply to the periodic epidemics of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.",

Historically, variations in the EASM have had major impacts including flooding and drought. We present an analysis of the impact of anthropogenic climate change on EASM rainfall in Eastern China using a newly updated attribution system. Our results suggest that anthropogenic climate change has led to an overall decrease in total monsoon rainfall over the past 65 years, and an increased number of dry days. However the model also predicts that anthropogenic forcings have caused the most extreme heavy rainfall events to become shorter in duration and more intense. With the potential for future changes in aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions, historical trends in monsoon rainfall may not be indicative of future changes, although extreme rainfall is projected to increase over East Asia with continued warming in the region.",

Here we assess the impact of climate change on global river flows and river water temperatures, and identify regions that might become more critical for freshwater ecosystems and water use sectors. We used a global physically based hydrological-water temperature modelling framework forced with an ensemble of bias-corrected general circulation model (GCM) output for both the SRES A2 and B1 emissions scenario. This resulted in global projections of daily river discharge and water temperature under future climate. Our results show an increase in the seasonality of river discharge (both increase in high flow and decrease in low flow) for about one-third of the global land surface area for 2071\u20132100 relative to 1971\u20132000. Global mean and high (95th percentile) river water temperatures are projected to increase on average by 0.8\u20131.6 (1.0\u20132.2)Â Â°C for the SRES B1\u2013A2 scenario for 2071\u20132100 relative to 1971\u20132000. The largest water temperature increases are projected for the United States, Europe, eastern China, and parts of southern Africa and Australia. In these regions, the sensitivities are exacerbated by projected decreases in low flows (resulting in a reduced thermal capacity). For strongly seasonal rivers with highest water temperatures during the low flow period, up to 26\\% of the increases in high (95th percentile) water temperature can be attributed indirectly to low flow changes, and the largest fraction is attributable directly to increased atmospheric energy input. A combination of large increases in river temperature and decreases in low flows are projected for the southeastern United States, Europe, eastern China, southern Africa and southern Australia. These regions could potentially be affected by increased deterioration of water quality and freshwater habitats, and reduced water available for human uses such as thermoelectric power and drinking water production. Ã¢\u0096Âº We assessed impacts of climate change on low flows and river temperatures globally. Ã¢\u0096Âº The largest predicted water temperature rises are for the US, Europe and China. Ã¢\u0096Âº Water temperature rises are exacerbated by decreasing summer low flows in most regions.",

This study examines this statement by juxtaposing brochure content produced by 12 hotels located in Playacar, Mexico - a coastal tourism enclave devastated by biophysical changes in the natural landscape - to online tourists' co-constructions of the same landscape. The findings reveal that despite the biophysical changes, the industry continues to promote essentialist representations and tourists are increasingly using online networking sites to counter these dominant promotional narratives. It is argued that promoters will need to embrace non essentialist frames that portray landscape dynamism and the inextricable co-evolution between humans and the environment. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

Recent research on adaptation in developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and should be situated in the milieu of people\u2019s daily lives and temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second home-owners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of place-specific and people-centric values for achieving fair adaptation.",

To this end, published results indicate that the impacts of climate change are significant, however, with a wide projected range (between 5 million and 170 million additional people at risk of hunger by 2080) strongly depending on assumed socio-economic development. The likely impacts of climate change on the other important dimensions of food security are discussed qualitatively, indicating the potential for further negative impacts beyond those currently assessed with models. Finally, strengths and weaknesses of current assessment studies are discussed, suggesting improvements and proposing avenues for new analyses.",

One manifestation of this is the substantial spread in projections for the extratropical storm tracks made by different state-of-the-art climate models. In this study we perform a series of sensitivity experiments, with the atmosphere component of a single climate model, in order to identify the causes of the differences between storm track responses in different models. In particular, the Northern Hemisphere wintertime storm tracks in the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble are considered. A number of potential physical drivers of storm track change are identified and their influence on the storm tracks is assessed. The experimental design aims to perturb the different physical drivers independently, by magnitudes representative of the range of values present in the CMIP3 model runs, and this is achieved via perturbations to the sea surface temperature and the sea-ice concentration forcing fields. We ask the question: can the spread of projections for the extratropical storm tracks present in the CMIP3 models be accounted for in a simple way by any of the identified drivers? The results suggest that, whilst the changes in the upper-tropospheric equator-to-pole temperature difference have an influence on the storm track response to climate change, the large spread of projections for the extratropical storm track present in the northern North Atlantic in particular is more strongly associated with changes in the lower-tropospheric equator-to-pole temperature difference.",

Many leishmaniases are rural zoonoses, and so there is a foundation of descriptive ecology and qualitative risk assessment. Dogs are widespread reservoir hosts of veterinary importance. Recent statistical modelling has not always produced novel general conclusions, exemplifying the difficulty of applying models outside the original geographical region. Case studies are given for transmission cycles involving both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the Old World and the Americas. An important challenge is to integrate statistical spatial models based mainly on climate with more explanatory biological models. Ecological niche models pose difficulties because of the number of assumptions. A positive association has been reported between the El NiÃ±o cycle and the annual incidence of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil, but more basic research is needed before tackling other climate-change scenarios, including leishmaniasis emergence in northern Europe.",

Using bioclimatic envelope models, we evaluate the potential impact of climate change on the distributions and species richness of 120 native terrestrial non-volant European mammals under two of IPCC's future climatic scenarios. Assuming unlimited and no migration, respectively, our model predicts that 1% or 5.9% of European mammals risk extinction, while 32.46% or 70.78% may be severely threatened (lose 30% of their current distribution) under the two scenarios. Under the no migration assumption endemic species were predicted to be strongly negatively affected by future climatic changes, while widely distributed species would be more mildly affected. Finally, potential mammalian species richness is predicted to become dramatically reduced in the Mediterranean region but increase towards the northeast and for higher elevations. Bioclimatic envelope models do not account for non-climatic factors such as land-use, biotic interactions, human interference, dispersal or history, and our results should therefore be seen as first approximations of the potential magnitude of future climatic changes.",

Adaptation is a dynamic social process: the ability of societies to adapt is determined, in part, by the ability to act collectively. This article reviews emerging perspectives on collective action and social capital and argues that insights from these areas inform the nature of adaptive capacity and normative prescriptions of policies of adaptation. Specifically, social capital is increasingly understood within economics to have public and private elements, both of which are based on trust, reputation, and reciprocal action. The public-good aspects of particular forms of social capital are pertinent elements of adaptive capacity in interacting with natural capital and in relation to the performance of institutions that cope with the risks of changes in climate. Case studies are presented of present-day collective action for coping with extremes in weather in coastal areas in Southeast Asia and of community-based coastal management in the Caribbean. These cases demonstrate the importance of social capital framing both the public and private institutions of resource management that build resilience in the face of the risks of changes in climate. These cases illustrate, by analogy, the nature of adaptation processes and collective action in adapting to future changes in climate.",

The author, who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, argues that single policies adopted only at a global scale are unlikely to generate sufficient trust among citizens and firms so that collective action can take place in a comprehensive and transparent manner that will effectively reduce global warming. Furthermore, simply recommending a single governmental unit to solve global collective action problems is inherently weak because of free-rider problems. For example, the Carbon Development Mechanism (CDM) can be \u0091gamed\u0092 in ways that hike up prices of natural resources and in some cases can lead to further natural resource exploitation. Some flaws are also noticeable in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) program. Both the CDM and REDD are vulnerable to the free-rider problem. As an alternative, the paper proposes a polycentric approach at various levels with active oversight of local, regional, and national stakeholders. Efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions are a classic collective action problem that is best addressed at multiple scales and levels. Given the slowness and conflict involved in achieving a global solution to climate change, recognizing the potential for building a more effective way of reducing green house gas emissions at multiple levels is an important step forward. A polycentric approach has the main advantage of encouraging experimental efforts at multiple levels, leading to the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one type of ecosystem and compared to results obtained in other ecosystems. Building a strong commitment to find ways of reducing individual emissions is an important element for coping with this problem, and having others also take responsibility can be more effectively undertaken in small- to medium-scale governance units that are linked together through information networks and monitoring at all levels. This paper was prepared as a background paper for the 2010 World Development Report on Climate Change.",

It is known that these techniques may alter the mean climate signal of the adjusted variable; however, the effect on the projected occurrence of climate extremes is less commonly investigated. Here the outputs of an ensemble of high-resolution (0.11Â°) regional climate models (RCM) from the Coordinated Regional-climate Downscaling Experiment for Europe (EURO-CORDEX) have been bias adjusted, and a number of climate indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices have been calculated for the present (1981\u20132010) and future (2071\u20132100) climate. Indices include absolute-thresholds indices, percentile-based indices, and indices based on the duration of an event. Results show that absolute-threshold indices are largely affected by bias adjustment, as they depend strongly on both the present mean climate value (usually largely biased in the original RCMs) and its shift under climate change. The change of percentile-based indices is less affected by bias adjustment, as that of indices based on the duration of an event (e.g., consecutive dry days or heat waves) although the present climate value can differ between original and bias-adjusted results. Indices like R95ptot (the total amount of precipitation larger than the 95th reference percentile) are largely affected by bias adjustment, although, when analyzing an ensemble of RCMs, the differences are usually smaller than, or comparable to, the intermodel variability.",

Understanding the diverse health risks from climate change, and their influence pathways, presents a challenge to environmental health researchers whose prior work has been in a more definable, specific and quantitative milieu. Extension of the research agenda and conceptual framework to assess present and future health risks from climate change may be constrained by three factors: (i) lack of historically-informed understanding of population-health sensitivity to climatic changes;  (ii) an instinctual 'epidemiologising' tendency to choose research topics amenable to conventional epidemiological analysis and risk estimation; and (iii) under-confidence in relation to interdisciplinary collaborative scenario-based modeling of future health risks. These constraints must be recognized and remedied. And environmental researchers must argue for heightened public attention to today's macro-environmental threats to present and future population health\u2014emphasising the ecological dimension of these determinants of long-term health that apply to whole populations and communities, not just to individuals and social groupings.",

         "volume": "15","number": "1","pages": "97-134","abstract": "This paper proposes an alternative approach to addressing the complex problems of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The author, who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, argues that single policies adopted only at a global scale are unlikely to generate sufficient trust among citizens and firms so that collective action can take place in a comprehensive and transparent manner that will effectively reduce global warming. Furthermore, simply recommending a single governmental unit to solve global collective action problems is inherently weak because of free-rider problems. For example, the Carbon Development Mechanism (CDM) can be `gamed' in ways that hike up prices of natural resources and in some cases can lead to further natural resource exploitation. Some flaws are also noticeable in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) program. Both the CDM and REDD are vulnerable to the free-rider problem. As an alternative, the paper proposes a polycentric approach at various levels with active oversight of local, regional, and national stakeholders. Efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions are a classic collective action problem that is best addressed at multiple scales and levels. Given the slowness and conflict involved in achieving a global solution to climate change, recognizing the potential for building a more effective way of reducing green house gas emissions at multiple levels is an important step forward. A polycentric approach has the main advantage of encouraging experimental efforts at multiple levels, leading to the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one type of ecosystem and compared to results obtained in other ecosystems. Building a strong commitment to find ways of reducing individual emissions is an important element for coping with this problem, and having others also take responsibility can be more effectively undertaken in small- to medium-scale governance units that are linked together through information networks and monitoring at all levels. This paper was prepared as a background paper for the 2010 World Development Report on Climate Change.",

By formalising the current relationship between weather-related faults and weather, we use climate projections from a regional climate model (RCM) to quantitatively assess how the frequency of these faults may change in the future. This study found that the incidences of both lightning and solar heat faults are projected to increase in the future. There is evidence that the conditions that cause flooding faults may increase in the future, but a reduction cannot be ruled out. Due to the uncertainty associated with future wind projections, there is no clear signal associated with the future frequency of wind and gale faults, however snow, sleet and blizzard faults are projected to decrease due to a reduction in the number of snow days.",

However, it cannot be ruled out that the 1.5Â°C target passes a cost-benefit test. Costs are almost certainly high: The median global carbon price in 1.5Â°C scenarios implemented by various energy models is more than US\\$100 per metric ton of CO2 in 2020, for example. Benefits estimates range from much lower than this to much higher. Some of these uncertainties may reduce in the future, raising the question of how to hedge in the near term. Maintaining an option on limiting warming to 1.5Â°C means targeting it now. Setting off with higher emissions will make 1.5Â°C unattainable quickly without recourse to expensive large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR), or solar radiation management (SRM), which can be cheap but poses ambiguous risks society seems unwilling to take. Carbon pricing could reduce mitigation costs substantially compared with ramping up the current patchwork of regulatory instruments. Nonetheless, a mix of policies is justified and technology-specific approaches may be required. It is particularly important to step up mitigation finance to developing countries, where emissions abatement is relatively cheap.",

Each model has adopted boundary conditions from the same ensemble of global climate model integrations for present (1961Ã¢\u0080\u00931990) and future (2071Ã¢\u0080\u00932100) climate under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 emission scenario. The main diagnostics are multiyear return values of daily precipitation totals estimated from extreme value analysis. An evaluation of the RCMs against observations in the Alpine region shows that model biases for extremes are comparable to or even smaller than those for wet day intensity and mean precipitation. In winter, precipitation extremes tend to increase north of about 45Ã¯Â¿Â½N, while there is an insignificant change or a decrease to the south. In northern Europe the 20-year return value of future climate corresponds to the 40- to 100-year return value of present climate. There is a good agreement between the RCMs, and the simulated change is similar to a scaling of present-day extremes by the change in average events. In contrast, there are large model differences in summer when RCM formulation contributes significantly to scenario uncertainty. The model differences are well explained by differences in the precipitation frequency and intensity process, but in all models, extremes increase more or decrease less than would be expected from the scaling of present-day extremes. There is evidence for a component of the change that affects extremes specifically and is consistent between models despite the large variation in the total response.",

We introduce a model of a steam turbine power plant with once-through cooling at a river site and simulate how its production could be constrained in scenarios ranging from a one degree to a five degree increase of river temperature and a 10\u201350\\% decrease of stream flow. We apply the model to simulate a large nuclear power plant in Central Europe. We calculate annual average load reductions, which can be up to 11.8\\%, assuming unchanged stream flow, which leads to average annual income losses of up to 80Â million \u20AC. Considering simultaneous changes in stream flow will exacerbate the problem and may increase average annual costs to 111Â million \u20AC in a worst-case scenario. The model demonstrates that power generation could be severely constrained by typical climate impacts, such as increasing river temperatures and decreasing stream flow.",

         "volume": "16","number": "4","pages": "044027","abstract": "The UK is vulnerable to wildfire, and vulnerability is likely to increase due to climate change. Whilst the risk is small compared with many other countries, recent fires have raised awareness and highlighted the potential for environmental damage and loss of property and key infrastructure. Most UK wildfires are a result of inadvertent or deliberate human action, but the environmental conditions depend on antecedent and current weather. This paper presents projections of the effects of climate change on UK wildfire danger, using a version of an operational fire danger model, UKCP18 climate projections representing low and high emissions, and several indicators of fire danger. Fire danger will increase across the whole of the UK, but the extent and variability in change varies with indicator. The absolute danger now and into the future is greatest in the south and east (the average number of danger days increases 3\u20134 times by the 2080s), but danger increases further north from a lower base. The variation in change across the UK for indicators based on absolute thresholds is determined by how often those thresholds are exceeded now, whilst the (lesser) variability in percentile-based indicators reflects variability in the projected change in climate. Half of the increase in danger is due to increased temperature, and most of the rest is due to projected reductions in relative humidity. Uncertainty in the magnitude of the change is due to uncertainty in changes in temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, and there is a large difference between two of the UKCP18 climate model ensembles. Reducing emissions to levels consistent with achieving international climate policy targets significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, the increase in fire danger. The results imply that greater attention needs to be given to wildfire danger in both emergency and spatial planning, and in the development of guidelines for activities that may trigger fires. They suggest the need for the development of a fire danger system more tailored to UK conditions, and the combination of fire danger modelling with projections of sources of ignition to better estimate the change in wildfire risk.",

Such policies can affect poverty in developing countries either directly or indirectly. Direct impacts on poverty include payments for avoided deforestation that affect the livelihoods of the poor, reduced GHG emissions that also produce co-benefits of improved air quality and health, and clean energy and energy efficiency effects on energy poverty. Indirect impacts on the poor in developing countries occur through the changes in trade, economic growth, and other economy-wide effects. To date, there is a lack of systematic or comprehensive analyses of these direct and indirect impacts of mitigation policies on the poor. Although such policies may benefit the poor, some actions may worsen poverty and hinder its alleviation. This suggests that a more comprehensive approach should be employed in analyzing how mitigation policies affect the poor in developing countries, and in particular, in assessing how policy design and implementation can influence the potential trade-offs between the positive and negative impacts on poverty alleviation.

Here we report a systematic attempt to determine the range of climate changes consistent with these uncertainties, based on a 53-member ensemble of model versions constructed by varying model parameters. We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5\u201395 per cent probability range of 2.4\u20135.4Â Â°C. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation5, 6.",

         "volume": "29","number": "5","pages": "958--977","abstract": "An overview of basic research on climate change in recent years in China is presented. In the past 100 years in China, average annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) has increased at a rate ranging from 0.03Â°C (10 yr) â1 to 0.12Â°C (10 yr) â1 . This warming is more evident in northern China and is more significant in winter and spring. In the past 50 years in China, at least 27\\% of the average annual warming has been caused by urbanization. Overall, no significant trends have been detected in annual and/or summer precipitation in China on a whole for the past 100 years or 50 years. Both increases and decreases in frequencies of major extreme climate events have been observed for the past 50 years. The frequencies of extreme temperature events have generally displayed a consistent pattern of change across the country, while the frequencies of extreme precipitation events have shown only regionally and seasonally significant trends. The frequency of tropical cyclone landfall decreased slightly, but the frequency of sand/dust storms decreased significantly. Proxy records indicate that the annual mean SAT in the past a few decades is the highest in the past 400\u2013500 years in China, but it may not have exceeded the highest level of the Medieval Warm Period (1000\u20131300 AD). Proxy records also indicate that droughts and floods in eastern China have been characterized by continuously abnormal rainfall periods, with the frequencies of extreme droughts and floods in the 20th century most likely being near the average levels of the past 2000 years. The attribution studies suggest that increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere are likely to be a main factor for the observed surface warming nationwide. The Yangtze River and Huaihe River basins underwent a cooling trend in summer over the past 50 years, which might have been caused by increased aerosol concentrations and cloud cover. However, natural climate variability might have been a main driver for the mean and extreme precipitation variations observed over the past century. Climate models generally perform well in simulating the variations of annual mean SAT in China. They have also been used to project future changes in SAT under varied GHG emission scenarios. Large uncertainties have remained in these model-based projections, however, especially for the projected trends of regional precipitation and extreme climate events.",

         "pages": "1--14","abstract": "The urge for higher resolution climate change scenarios has been widely recognized, particularly for conducting impact assessment studies. Statistical downscaling methods have shown to be very convenient for this task, mainly because of their lower computational requirements in comparison with nested limited-area regional models or very high resolution Atmosphere\u2013ocean General Circulation Models. Nevertheless, although some of the limitations of statistical downscaling methods are widely known and have been discussed in the literature, in this paper it is argued that the current approach for statistical downscaling does not guard against misspecified statistical models and that the occurrence of spurious results is likely if the assumptions of the underlying probabilistic model are not satisfied. In this case, the physics included in climate change scenarios obtained by general circulation models, could be replaced by spatial patterns and magnitudes produced by statistically inadequate models. Illustrative examples are provided for monthly temperature for a region encompassing Mexico and part of the United States. It is found that the assumptions of the probabilistic models do not hold for about 70Â \\% of the gridpoints, parameter instability and temporal dependence being the most common problems. As our examples reveal, automated statistical downscaling  \u201D black-box\u201D models are to be considered as highly prone to produce misleading results. It is shown that the Probabilistic Reduction approach can be incorporated as a complete and internally consistent framework for securing the statistical adequacy of the downscaling models and for guiding the respecification process, in a way that prevents the lack of empirical validity that affects current methods.",

Observations show that heavy rainfall is increasing on daily timescales in many regions2, but how changes will manifest themselves on sub-daily timescales remains highly uncertain. Here we perform the first climate change experiments with a very high resolution (1.5 km grid spacing) model more typically used for weather forecasting, in this instance for a region of the UK. The model simulates realistic hourly rainfall characteristics, including extremes3, 4, unlike coarser resolution climate models5, 6, giving us confidence in its ability to project future changes at this timescale. We find the 1.5 km model shows increases in hourly rainfall intensities in winter, consistent with projections from a coarser 12 km resolution model and previous studies at the daily timescale7. However, the 1.5 km model also shows a future intensification of short-duration rain in summer, with significantly more events exceeding the high thresholds indicative of serious flash flooding. We conclude that accurate representation of the local storm dynamics is an essential requirement for predicting changes to convective extremes; when included we find for the model here that summer downpours intensify with warming.",

However, its agriculture water resources are threatened by climate change. In this paper, the CROPWAT model is used to evaluate crop water requirement (CWR), crop green water requirement (CGWR), and crop blue water requirement (CBWR) for main crops in NCP (winter wheat, summer maize, cotton, millet, and soybean) with a spatial resolution of 5 arc-minute from 1961 to 2010. Their responses to future climate changes are investigated. The results show that the mean annual total CWR of the main crops during growing periods amounted to 114.68Â km3 aâ1 in the past 50Â years. More than 72Â \\% of CWR to support NCP crop production is green water. The spatial distributions of CWR, CGWR, and CBWR are closely related to the planting areas and irrigation availability. Summer maize, millet, and soybean are high CGWR crops with proportions of above 84Â \\%, while the lowest CGWR proportion is in winter wheat, 58.89Â \\%. For climate change impacts in future, holding the crop planting system and irrigation conditions unchanged, it is projected that the total CWR in 2030s will require approximately 8.75--11.25Â km3 aâ1 additional water. Results show that the CWR increase in 2030s is mainly due to the increase in temperature. Under the projected temperature in 2030s and the current rainfall scenario, total CWR, CGWR, and CBWR increments were 8.58, 1.76, and 6.82Â km3 aâ1, respectively. Nearly 80Â \\% of the CWR increment is from the increase in CBWR. Therefore, agricultural water shortage crisis will further aggravate under future climate change scenarios in NCP, and effective water-saving measures must be taken to mitigate the negative effects of climate change.",

Here, we show that warming and drying of the Southwestern United States over the last 25 years has corresponded to a shift in the species composition of Sonoran Desert winter annuals, paradoxically favoring species that germinate and grow best in cold temperatures. Winter rains have been arriving later in the season, during December rather than October, leading to the unexpected result that plants are germinating under colder temperatures, shifting community composition to favor slow growing, water-use efficient, cold-adapted species. Our results demonstrate how detailed ecophysiological knowledge of individual species, combined with long-term demographic data, can reveal complex and sometimes unexpected shifts in community composition in response to climate change. Further, these results highlight the potentially overwhelming impact of changes in phenology on the response of biota to a changing climate.",

The challenge to find an adequate and readable representation of uncertainty in this context is large and research is just in the initial phase to provide solutions to the problem. Our goal is to present the structure required to address spatial and temporal uncertainty within ci:grasp. We compare existing concepts and representations for uncertainty communication with current practices on webbased platforms. From our review we derive an uncertainty framework for climate information going beyond what is currently present in the web. We make use of a multi-step approach in communicating the uncertainty and a typology of uncertainty distinguishing between epistemic, natural stochastic, and human reflexive uncertainty.

The species-specific models employ a hybrid approach that simulates population dynamics and long-distance dispersal on top of expected spatio-temporal dynamics of suitable habitat.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nClimate change was mainly predicted to reduce range size and range filling (because of a combination of strong habitat shifts with low migration ability). In contrast, habitat loss mostly decreased mean local abundance. For most species and response measures, the combination of habitat loss and climate change had the most severe effect. Yet, this combined effect was mostly smaller than expected from adding or multiplying effects of the individual environmental drivers. This seems to be because climate change shifts suitable habitats to regions less affected by habitat loss. Interspecific variation in range size responses depended mostly on the severity of environmental change, whereas responses in range filling and local abundance depended mostly on demographic properties of species. While most surviving populations concentrated in areas that remain climatically suitable, refugia for multiple species were overestimated by simply overlying habitat models and ignoring demography.\r\n\r\nMain conclusions\r\nDemographic models of range dynamics can simultaneously predict the response of range size, abundance and range filling to multiple drivers of environmental change. Demographic knowledge is particularly needed to predict abundance responses and to identify areas that can serve as biodiversity refugia under climate change. These findings highlight the need for data-driven, demographic assessments in conservation biogeography.",

The primary research vehicle in our investigation was the standard version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) CCM3 global climate model (GCM), with a horizontal resolution of triangular spectral truncation T42 (approximately 2.8Â° x 2.8Â°). Two separate 10 yr simulations were performed; for each of these the global climatological sea surface temperature field was prescribed. The purpose of the 10 yr simulations was to provide a sufficiently large ensemble whose average minimizes model noise errors. In the control simulation normal vegetation was prescribed. The design of the anomaly experiment was similar to the control run except that the tropical rainforest regions in Africa were replaced by savanna grassland vegetation. The CCM3 GCM successfully simulated the primary features of the seasonal mean climate conditions over Africa. The model results show that replacement of tropical rain forest vegetation with savanna grassland vegetation produces the following climate changes over Africa: (1) Over the deforested region, the model results indicate a significant reduction in area-averaged rainfall throughout the year. The decrease ranges between 2 to 3 mm d-1 during the northern hemispheric summer months, when the region experiences the driest conditions (July to September), and less than 1 mm d-1 during the wettest months (autumn and spring). (2) Over southern Africa deforestation results in substantial rainfall reduction over Mozambique and rainfall increase over Botswana, Zambia, the southern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and parts of South Africa. Changes in the trapped Rossby wave train activity generated by the mid-tropospheric latent heating over the tropical forest region are responsible for the continental-scale teleconnection climate response. (3) Over Eastern and Western Africa the impact of deforestation is primarily characterized by a reduction in rainfall, however the adopted GCM T42 resolution may not have been adequate to resolve the large contrasts in terrain and vegetation types. (4) Over the rest of Africa the response is relatively weak.",

Previous studies suggested an influence of topography on these effects, a possibility tested herein. Bird species with distributions restricted to montane (26 species) and Great Plains (19 species) regions of central and western North America were modeled, and climate change effects on their distributions compared: in general, plains species were more heavily influenced by climate change, with drastic area reductions (mode 35% of distributional area lost under assumption of no dispersal) and dramatic spatial movements (02013400 km shift of range centroid under assumption of no dispersal) of appropriate habitats. These results suggest an important generality regarding climate change effects on biodiversity, and provide useful guidelines for conservation planning.",

Three objectives and three research questions were raised and answered, and three null hypotheses were tested. A non randomized pre test post test quasi experimental design was adopted for the study. The population covered all public Senior Secondary School, year three SSS 3 science students in Lokoja, Kogi State. Two intact classes which are made up of one hundred and thirty 130 students were sampled. The instruments for data collection are Environmental Education Concept Achievement Test EECAT , Environmental Education Concept Retention Test EECRT and Environmental Education Concept Interest Scale EECAS respectively. Statistical tools used include percentages, mean xÃÂ¯ and standard deviations to answer the research questions while Analysis of Covariance ANCOVA was used to analyze the research hypotheses at a significance level 0.05 5 . Findings of the study revealed that animation teaching was viable in upgrading students achievement, retention and interest in climate change. The paper recommended among others that teachers should teach Environmental Education infused concepts with animations.

         "pages": "C7+","abstract": "We propose that changes in the magnitude of oceanic tidal mixing on long time scales is an important, but previously unrecognized, contributor to global climate change. It is well known that Earth's orbital and rotational state changes significantly on 10^4-10^5 year time scales, and that this influences the spatial and temporal pattern of incident radiation. It is widely supposed that climatic variations on these same time scales are, in large part, a response of the ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system to this radiative forcing. Our proposal is that variations in the luni-solar tidal potential, induced by these same orbital and rotational variations, influences oceanic mixing and thus modulates meridional heat transport, by amounts which are competitive with the radiative forcing. There are some obvious differences between tidal potential and insolation. First is that the Sun and Moon both contribute to tides, whereas the radiation is entirely of solar origin. Second is that the Earth is transparent to gravity but opaque to radiation. Clipping associated with this opacity makes the radiation pattern temporal spectrum rather more complex than the tidal spectrum. A third point is that solar radiation directly delivers energy to Earth's surface whereas tidal mixing will only expedite lateral transport of heat in association with oceanic thermo-haline circulation. The diurnal average insolation pattern is best parameterized via a Fourier series in time of year and Legendre polynomials in sine of latitude. Our present focus will be on the annual average terms. The Legendre degree n=0 term describes the global average insolation, and is nearly constant. The degree n=1 term describes differences between northern and southern hemispheres, and the annual mean is zero. The degree n=2 term is the main contributor to the equator to pole variations, and varies with obliquity and orbital eccentricity, with the obliquity variation dominating. The lowest order decomposition of the tidal potential recognizes 3 constituents: semi-diurnal, diurnal, and long period, with solar and lunar contributions to each. Our present focus will be on long term variations in the mean square amplitude of the semi-diurnal constituent, with averaging over all the short period variations. For the solar tide that includes the day and year. For the lunar tide it includes the day, month, year, and the apsidal (8.85 year) and nodal (18.6 year) periods. We present calculations of the variations in radiative and tidal forcing for the past 3 million years. The two signals are quite similar. Both vary by ~1% of their respective mean values, are dominated by obliquity variations, and exhibit only secondary influence from orbital eccentricity.",

This paper provides consistent estimates of global and regional impacts and risks at increases in global mean temperature up to 5Â Â°C above pre-industrial levels, for over 30 indicators representing temperature extremes and heatwaves, hydrological change, floods and droughts and proxies for impacts on crop yields. At the global scale, all the impacts that could plausibly be either adverse or beneficial are adverse, and impacts and risks increase with temperature change. For example, the global average chance of a major heatwave increases from 5\\% in 1981--2010 to 28\\% at 1.5Â Â°C and 92\\% at 4Â Â°C, of an agricultural drought increases from 9 to 24\\% at 1.5Â Â°C and 61\\% at 4Â Â°C, and of the 50-year return period river flood increases from 2 to 2.4\\% at 1.5Â Â°C and 5.4\\% at 4Â Â°C. The chance of a damaging hot spell for maize increases from 5 to 50\\% at 4Â Â°C, whilst the chance for rice rises from 27 to 46\\%. There is considerable uncertainty around these central estimates, and impacts and risks vary between regions. Some impacts---for example heatwaves---increase rapidly as temperature increases, whilst others show more linear responses. The paper presents estimates of the risk of impacts exceeding specific targets and demonstrates that these estimates are sensitive to the thresholds used.",

Even under the best-case scenario, hundreds of millions will face food insecurity, forced migration, disease and death. Climate change threatens the future of human rights and risks undoing the last 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction.\r\n\r\nStaying the course will be disastrous for the global economy and pull vast numbers into poverty. Addressing climate change will require a fundamental shift in the global economy, decoupling improvements in economic well-being from fossil fuel emissions. It is imperative that this is done in a way that provides necessary support, protects workers and creates decent work.\r\n\r\nGovernments and too many in the human rights community have failed to seriously address climate change for decades. Sombre speeches by government officials have not led to meaningful action and too many countries continue taking short-sighted steps in the wrong direction. States are paying only marginal attention to human rights in the conversation on climate change.\r\n\r\nAlthough climate change has been on the human rights agenda for well over a decade, it remains a marginal concern for most actors. However, it represents an emergency without precedent and requires bold and creative thinking from the human rights community and a radically more robust, detailed and coordinated approach.",

To deal with these biases, several bias correction methods have been developed recently, ranging from simple scaling to rather sophisticated approaches. This paper provides a review of available bias correction methods and demonstrates how they can be used to correct for deviations in an ensemble of 11 different RCM-simulated temperature and precipitation series. The performance of all methods was assessed in several ways: At first, differently corrected RCM data was compared to observed climate data. The second evaluation was based on the combined influence of corrected RCM-simulated temperature and precipitation on hydrological simulations of monthly mean streamflow as well as spring and autumn flood peaks for five catchments in Sweden under current (1961\u20131990) climate conditions. Finally, the impact on hydrological simulations based on projected future (2021\u20132050) climate conditions was compared for the different bias correction methods. Improvement of uncorrected RCM climate variables was achieved with all bias correction approaches. While all methods were able to correct the mean values, there were clear differences in their ability to correct other statistical properties such as standard deviation or percentiles. Simulated streamflow characteristics were sensitive to the quality of driving input data: Simulations driven with bias-corrected RCM variables fitted observed values better than simulations forced with uncorrected RCM climate variables and had more narrow variability bounds. Ã¢\u0096Âº Several methods for correcting biased climate model output were analyzed. Ã¢\u0096Âº All reviewed correction methods are somewhat able to improve original climate model data. Ã¢\u0096Âº More sophisticated higher-skill approaches outperform simpler approaches. Ã¢\u0096Âº The choice of bias correction method is relevant for assessing hydrological change. Ã¢\u0096Âº The application of bias correction algorithms can considerably improve hydrological simulations.",

When comparing simulations with each other and with observations, it is standard practice to compare temperature anomalies with respect to a reference period. It is not always appreciated that the choice of reference period can affect conclusions, both about the skill of simulations of past climate and about the magnitude of expected future changes in climate. For example, observed global temperatures over the past decade are toward the lower end of the range of the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations irrespective of what reference period is used, but exactly where they lie in the model distribution varies with the choice of reference period. Additionally, we demonstrate that projections of when particular temperature levels are reached, for example, 2 K above ?preindustrial,? change by up to a decade depending on the choice of reference period. In this article, we discuss some of the key issues that arise when using anomalies relative to a reference period to generate climate projections. We highlight that there is no perfect choice of reference period. When evaluating models against observations, a long reference period should generally be used, but how long depends on the quality of the observations available. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) choice to use a 1986?2005 reference period for future global temperature projections was reasonable, but a case-by-case approach is needed for different purposes and when assessing projections of different climate variables. Finally, we recommend that any studies that involve the use of a reference period should explicitly examine the robustness of the conclusions to alternative choices.",

Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.",

Here, using four niche-based models, two methods to derive probability values from models into presence2013absence data and five climate change scenarios, I project the future potential habitats of 1350 European plant species for 2050. All 40 different projections of species turnover across Europe suggested high potential species turnover (up to 70%) in response to climate change. However variability in the potential distributional changes of species across climate scenarios was obscured by a strong variability in projections arising from alternative, yet equally justifiable, niche-based models. Therefore, projections of future species distributions and derived community descriptors cannot be reliably discussed unless model uncertainty is quantified explicitly. I propose and test an alternative way to account for modelling variability when deriving estimates of species turnover (with and without dispersal) according to a range of climate change scenarios representing various socio-economic futures.",

The sea state was simulated for the 30-year period 2071\u20132100 using the wave model WAM and an ensemble of wind field data sets for four climate change realizations as driving data. The wind field data sets are based on simulation outputs from two global circulation models (GCMs: HadAM3H and ECHAM4/OPYC3) for two emission scenarios (A2 and B2, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Special Report on Emission Scenarios). They were regionalized by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute using the regional climate model RCAO. The effects of the climate realizations on the sea state statistics were assessed by analyzing the differences between the patterns in the four CGM/emission scenario combinations and those in two control simulations representing reference wave climate conditions for the 30-year period 1961\u20131990. The analysis of the four emission scenario/GCM combinations has shown that the future long-term 99 percentile wind speed and significant wave height increase by up to 7\\% and 18\\%, respectively, in the North Sea, except for significant wave height off the English coast and to the north in the HadAM3H-driven simulation. The climate change response in the ECHAM4/OPYC3-forced experiments is generally larger than in the HadAM3H-driven simulations. The differences in future significant wave height between the different combinations are in the same order of magnitude as those between the control runs for the two GCMs. Nevertheless, there is agreement among the four combinations that extreme wave heights may increase in large parts in the southern and eastern North Sea by about 0.25 to 0.35Â m (5\u20138\\% of present values) towards the end of the twenty first century in case of global warming. All combinations also show an increase in future frequency of severe sea state.",

Model output is typically averaged over several decades3 so that the anthropogenic climate change signal stands out from the largely unpredictable 'noise' of climate variability. Similar averaging periods (30-year) are used for regional climate projections4, 5, 6 to inform adaptation. According to two such projections, UKCIP02 (ref. 4) and UKCP09 (ref. 6), the UK will experience 'hotter drier summers and warmer wetter winters'7, 8 in the future. This message is about a typical rather than any individual future season, and these projections should not be compared directly to observed weather as this neglects the sizeable contribution from year-to-year climate variability. Therefore, despite the apparent contradiction with the messages, it is a fallacy to suggest the recent cold UK winters like 2009/2010 disprove human-made climate change9. Nevertheless, such claims understandably cause public confusion and doubt10. Here we include year-to-year variability to provide projections for individual seasons. This approach has two advantages. First, it allows fair comparisons with recent weather events, for instance showing that recent cold winters are within projected ranges. Second, it allows the projections to be expressed in terms of the extreme hot, cold, wet or dry seasons that impact society, providing a better idea of adaptation needs.",

Substantial uncertainties exist, however, regarding the impact, capacity and sustainability of biochar at the global level. In this paper we estimate the maximum sustainable technical potential of biochar to mitigate climate change. Annual net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide could be reduced by a maximum of 1.8 Pg CO2-C equivalent (CO2-Ce) per year (12\\% of current anthropogenic CO2-Ce emissions; 1 Pg=1 Gt), and total net emissions over the course of a century by 130 Pg CO2-Ce, without endangering food security, habitat or soil conservation. Biochar has a larger climate-change mitigation potential than combustion of the same sustainably procured biomass for bioenergy, except when fertile soils are amended while coal is the fuel being offset.",

The aim is to provide a basis for probabilistic predictions in which the impact of prior assumptions and observational constraints can be clearly distinguished. Here we report on the first perturbed physics coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean model ensemble in which poorly constrained atmosphere, land and sea-ice component parameters are varied in the third version of the Hadley Centre model (the variation of ocean parameters will be the subject of future study). Flux adjustments are employed, both to reduce regional sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases and also to admit the use of combinations of model parameter values which give non-zero values for the global radiation balance. This improves the extent to which the ensemble provides a credible basis for the quantification of uncertainties in climate change, especially at a regional level. However, this particular implementation of flux-adjustments leads to a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, resulting in the development of biases in SST and sea ice in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, model versions are produced which are of similar quality to the unperturbed and un-flux-adjusted version. The ensemble is used to simulate pre-industrial conditions and a simple scenario of a 1\\% per year compounded increase in CO2. The range of transient climate response (the 20Â year averaged global warming at the time of CO2 doubling) is 1.5\u20132.6Â°C, similar to that found in multi-model studies. Measures of global and large scale climate change from the coupled models show simple relationships with associated measures computed from atmosphere-mixed-layer-ocean climate change experiments, suggesting that recent advances in computing the probability density function of climate change under equilibrium conditions using the perturbed physics approach may be extended to the transient case.",

Recent studies have tried to link such uncertainty to inter-model differences in the pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) change. On the other hand, coupled climate models also contain systematic biases in their climatology, largely due to drift in SSTs. To the extent that the projected changes depend on the mean state, biases in the present-day climatology also contribute to the inter-model spread in climate change projections. By comparing atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations using the climatological SSTs from different coupled models, we show that biases in the climatological SST generally have a larger impact on regional projections over land than do inter-model differences in the pattern of SST change. These results advocate for a greater application of AGCM simulations with observed SSTs or flux-adjusted coupled models to improve regional projections of anthropogenic climate change.",

Although replete with general \u2018climate adaptation\u2019 strategies, this literature provides relatively limited guidance on translating these strategies into actionable conservation prescriptions. This review synthesizes information from the conservation planning and climate adaptation literature, including climate adaptation plans developed in Canada, England, MÃ©xico, South Africa, and USA, and presents elements of a general approach for developing actionable adaptation measures for wildlife species and conservation areas. Grounded in an adaptive management framework, this approach incorporates existing conservation tools for land and water protection, land and water management, species conservation, and monitoring, and also integrates new information from climate models, sensitivity analyses, and vulnerability assessments for species and ecosystems.

Here, we summarise the epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect various health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that recent global warming has already affected some health outcomes. We review the published estimates of future health effects of climate change over coming decades. Research so far has mostly focused on thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, with some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger prevalence. An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of health risks due to the social, demographic, and economic disruptions of climate change. Evidence and anticipation of adverse health effects will strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and will also guide priorities for planned adaptive strategies.",

A statistical model is built that represents the seasonal cycle, climate change, magnitude and temporal behaviour of all temperatures above a moderately high time varying threshold at a site from which very large samples of temperature time series can be drawn. From these, user defined heatwaves can be extracted and precise empirical statistics calculated, allowing application to a wide range of problems such as heatwave impact on the pollination of food crops. Fitting the heatwave model to climate model simulations allows the changing severity, duration and frequency of heatwaves from the past to the future to be quantified. This approach is validated by reproducing the heatwave climatology of a pre-industrial 3Â 500 year GCM control run from a 110 year future emission run of the same GCM. Using this methodology, future heatwave changes for the most populous cities from 20 countries are derived from a 44 member ensemble of 28 GCMs from the CMIP5 archive forced with the RCP 8.5 emission scenario. Compared to 2006, absolute temperatures of 4\u201310 day long heatwaves are projected to be between 3.4 to 6.6Â Â°C hotter in 2099, though the magnitude of the increases are independent of heatwave rarity and duration. For 13 of the cities no significant future changes in the distribution of durations are found relative to a contemporaneous threshold. Six cities show future heatwaves will have a tendency to be longer and one to be shorter. Half of the cities show increases in severity, the time integrated temperature anomalies above the contemporaneous threshold. The largest changes are found for Paris with 100 year return level severity changes equivalent to mean heatwave temperatures increasing by 3.4 Â°C or by 1.7 Â°C for 5 and 10 day heatwaves respectively, and the rate of 10 day heatwaves increasing by 130%.",

Using the calibrated and validated RZWQM2 (coupled with CERES-Maize and CROPGRO in DSSAT), the potential effects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (CO2) on tile drainage volume, NO3-N losses, and crop production were assessed integrally for the first time for a corn-soybean rotation cropping system near Gilmore City, Iowa. RZWQM2 simulated results under 20-year observed historical weather data (1990-2009) and ambient CO2 were compared to those under 20-year projected future meteorological data (2045-2064) and elevated CO2, with all management practices unchanged. The results showed that, under the future climate, tile drainage, NO3-N loss and flow-weighted average NO3-N concentration (FWANC) increased by 4.2 cm year(-1) (+14.5 \\%), 11.6 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (+33.7 \\%) and 2.0 mg L-1 (+16.4 \\%), respectively. Yields increased by 875 kg ha(-1) (+28.0 \\%) for soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. but decreased by 1380 kg ha(-1) (-14.7 \\%) for corn (Zea mays L.). The yield of the C-3 soybean increased mostly due to CO2 enrichment but increased temperature had negligible effect. However, the yield of C-4 corn decreased largely because of fewer days to physiological maturity due to increased temperature and limited benefit of elevated CO2 to corn yield under subhumid climate. Relative humidity, short wave radiation and wind speed had small or negligible impacts on FWANC or grain yields. With the predicted trend, this study suggests that to mitigate NO3-N pollution from subsurface drained corn-soybean field in Iowa is a more challenging task in the future without changing current management practices. This study also demonstrates the advantage of an agricultural system model in assessing climate change impacts on water quality and crop production. Further investigation on management practice adaptation is needed.",

         "abstract": "The aim of this project was to bring together a range of work to examine the global impacts of climate change at different degrees of temperature rise (up to 5Â°C where possible), identifying vulnerable sectors in different parts of the world. The project aims to analyse impacts work in a consistent way, explicitly identifying assumptions between different results, and provides a basis for comparison with how impacts are handled in integrated assessment models. A key output of the project is the set of impacts matrices accompanying this report showing impacts in various sectors and regions. All annual global mean temperature increases mentioned in this report refer to a baseline date of 1990.\n\nThe DEFRA-funded FastTrack and related work formed the bedrock for impacts matrices which ensures that a consistent up to date methodology and full set of SRES scenarios. For each sector the main factors driving variation and uncertainty in impacts were unpacked as far as the literature and available Fast Track data and models allow. These factors were variously (i) the choice of socio-economic scenario (ii) the adaptation assumptions, (iii) the direct effects of carbon dioxide (CO2), and (iv) the variability between different global circulation models (GCMs).\n\nThe project assessed climate impacts upon water stress, agriculture, coastal flooding,human health, energy demand, and ecosystems (including biodiversity and global vegetation) out to 2100 in most cases. The regional assessment is based upon 13 world regions. A key consideration is that, with the exception of coastal flooding due to storm surge the study cannot resolve the impacts of changing frequencies or intensities of short-term extreme weather events, so that the impact estimates given here may be considered an underestimation, since damages due to extreme weather events are already noticeably high.",

Within Joshua Tree National Park (JTNP), Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) reach their southern-most distribution. Previous research modeling distributional shifts of Joshua trees in response to climate change have been conducted at large regional scales, predicting widespread extirpation of Joshua trees from their current southern and central distribution. Here we employed the Mahalanobis \\D2\\ statistic and constructed a finer-scale model of the Joshua tree\u2019s current distribution within and surrounding JTNP, and then assessed their sensitivity to a gradient of climate change scenarios. Local scale analyses may identify local adaptations and climate-change refugia, a result which may not be possible with larger scale analyses. Under the most severe climate scenario we modeled (a 3 Â°C increase in mean July maximum temperature) there was a 90% reduction in their current distribution, nevertheless a refugium of suitable Joshua tree habitat still remained within JTNP. A niche model for juvenile Joshua trees revealed a near match with the boundary of the +1 Â°C shifted adult model providing a level of model validation, consistent with a hypothesis that early levels of climate change may have already had an impact on Joshua tree recruitment. The match of juvenile Joshua trees provides support for the findings of our climate-shifted niche models for the future distribution of this species within JTNP.

The study adopted survey method. The population of the study was made up of academic staff and non-academic staff of public universities in the zone. Purposive sampling method was used to select the respondents. Questionnaire was used as data collecting instrument in the study. The questionnaire was titled (Impact of climate change on university administration in Nigeria Questionnaire). Reliability obtained was established at 0.86 and 0.88 respectively using the Kinder Richardson Formula. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics of mean, and standard deviation. The result collected sowed that climate change (heavy rains and floods) have led to suspension of university administration, prevented universities\u2019 administrators from going to offices and increases the administrative cost of the universities in the of repairs and reconstruction of damages facilities. The result also revealed that climate change (heavy rains and floods) affected teaching, research and community service programme of the universities. The result also disclosed that climate change (heavy rain/floods) destroyed universities infrastructural facilities, disrupts energy, water and internet service supply in the universities in North-central Nigeria.",

In the North Sea, an area already prone to severe flooding, these high surge levels and waves are generated by low atmospheric pressure and severe wind speeds during storm events. As a result of the geometry of the North Sea, not only the maximum wind speed is relevant, but also wind direction. Climate change could change maximum wind conditions, with potentially negative effects for coastal safety. Here, we use an ensemble of 12 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) and diagnose the effect of two climate scenarios (rcp4.5 and rcp8.5) on annual maximum wind speed, wind speeds with lower return frequencies, and the direction of these annual maximum wind speeds. The 12 selected CMIP5 models do not project changes in annual maximum wind speed and in wind speeds with lower return frequencies; however, we do find an indication that the annual extreme wind events are coming more often from western directions. Our results are in line with the studies based on CMIP3 models and do not confirm the statement based on some reanalysis studies that there is a climate-change-related upward trend in storminess in the North Sea area.",

The methodology is illustrated by application to the Wave Hub site off the coast of Cornwall, UK. Control and future wave climates were derived using wind fields output from a set of climate change experiments. Control wave conditions were generated from wind data between 1961 and 2000. Future wave conditions were generated using two IPCC wind scenarios from 2061 to 2100, corresponding to intermediate and low greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC scenarios A1B and B1 respectively). The quantitative comparison between future scenarios and the control condition shows that the available wave power will increase by 2\u20133\\% in the A1B scenario. In contrast, the available wave power in the B1 scenario will decrease by 1\u20133\\%, suggesting, somewhat paradoxically, that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce the wave energy resource. Meanwhile, the WEC energy will yield decrease by 2\u20133\\% in both A1B and B1 scenarios, which is mainly due to the relatively low efficiency of energy extraction from steeper waves by the specific WEC considered. Although those changes are relatively small compared to the natural variability, they may have significance when considered over the lifetime of a wave energy farm. Analysis of downtime under low and high thresholds suggests that the distribution of wave heights at the Wave Hub will have a wider spread due to the impacts of climate change, resulting in longer periods of generation loss. Conversely, the estimation of future changes in joint wave height-period distribution provides indications on how the response and power matrices of WECs could be modified in order to maintain or improve energy extraction in the future. Ã¢\u0096Âº A generic methodology for assessing the impacts of climate change on wave energy generation is presented. Ã¢\u0096Âº The methodology is illustrated by application to the Wave Hub site off the coast of Cornwall, UK. Ã¢\u0096Âº Comparison of future scenarios and control conditions shows statistically significant changes.

In recent years, prickly pear cultivation has increased mainly because this plant used for food, medicinal and livestock purposes is able to withstand extreme drought conditions in relatively poor soils. The fruits of the prickly pear are of various colours such as yellow, orange, purple and white, and when ripe their sweet pulp is characterised by a low acidity. It possesses numerous nutritional and therapeutic virtues such as richness in carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and considerable antioxidant, anti-diabetes, anti-cancer fruit activity. Opuntia also has laxative properties due to its soluble fibres and mucilage. The infusion of the harvested and dried flowers has a depurative effect; it has a mild, gentle diuretic and relaxing action on the renal excretory system. Opuntias are also exploited as an alternative and cheap source of source of food for animals and as an ornamental plant.\r\nOpuntia ficus indica is grown in subtropical, tropical and warm-temperature areas; it is mainly cultivated in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. The Prickly Pear finds a particularly favourable habitat in Sardinia, Calabria, Apulia and Sicily, where it is also cultivated, as well as in Spain and North Africa, for the exploitation of its edible fruit, with its delicately sweet pulp, rich in minerals, especially calcium and phosphorus, and vitamin C. In this review, the characteristics, cultivation methods, main uses of the plant and fruits, market and adversities of Opuntia ficus indica are described.",

The consequences for world food prices and the number of people at risk of hunger as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO, 1988) have also been assessed. Climate change is expected to increase yields at high and mid-latitudes, and lead to decreases at lower latitudes. This pattern becomes more pronounced as time progresses. The food system may be expected to accommodate such regional variations at the global level, with production, prices and the risk of hunger being relatively unaffected by the additional stress of climate change. By the 2080s the additional number of people at risk of hunger due to climate change is about 80 million people (Â±10 million depending on which of the four HadCM2 ensemble members is selected). However, some regions (particularly the arid and sub-humid tropics) will be adversely affected. A particular example is Africa, which is expected to experience marked reductions in yield, decreases in production, and increases in the risk of hunger as a result of climate change. The continent can expect to have between 55 and 65 million extra people at risk of hunger by the 2080s under the HadCM2 climate scenario. Under the HadCM3 climate scenario the effect is even more severe, producing an estimated additional 70+ million people at risk of hunger in Africa.",

Here we show that thermoelectric power in Europe and the United States is vulnerable to climate change owing to the combined impacts of lower summer river flows and higher river water temperatures.

Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed \\~0.8oC over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0oC by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0-6.0oC by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Nino Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as bioclim consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5-1.0oC of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.",

         "abstract": "Questions were asked in the August 2006 National Statistics Omnibus Survey to assess public attitudes towards climate change and the impact of transport. These questions were repeated in April and August 2007. The key findings are as follows: Levels of concern and knowledge about climate change have remained reasonably stable across all three surveys, though climate change appears to have moved up the list of public policy priorities. In each survey around eight in ten adults felt that they themselves could have at least some influence on limiting climate change, with around three-quarters saying that they would be prepared to change their behaviour in some way to help limit climate change.",

         "abstract": "Although our knowledge of climate change impacts on energy systems has increased substantially over the past few decades, there remains a lack of comprehensive overview of impacts across spatial scales. Here, we analyse results of 220 studies projecting climate impacts on energy systems globally and at the regional scale. Globally, a potential increase in cooling demand and decrease in heating demand can be anticipated, in contrast to slight decreases in hydropower and thermal energy capacity. Impacts at the regional scale are more mixed and relatively uncertain across regions, but strongest impacts are reported for South Asia and Latin America. Our assessment shows that climate impacts on energy systems at regional and global scales are uncertain due partly to the wide range of methods and non-harmonized datasets used. For a comprehensive assessment of climate impacts on energy, we propose a consistent multi-model assessment framework to support regional-to-global-scale energy planning.",

They have had implications in a variety of sectors including agriculture, water resources, health, energy, and disaster management among others. Lake Victoria and its catchment support millions of people and any impact on its ability to support the livelihoods of the communities in this region is of major concern. Thus, the main objective of this study was to assess the potential future climatic changes on the Nzoia catchment in the Lake Victoria basin, and how they might affect streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to investigate the impact of climatic change on streamflow of the study area. The model was set up using readily available spatial and temporal data, and calibrated against measured daily streamflow. Climate change scenarios were obtained from general circulation models. Results obtained showed increased amounts of annual rainfall for all the scenarios but with variations on a monthly basis. All\u2014but one\u2014global circulation models (GCMs) showed consistency in the monthly rainfall amounts. Rainfall was higher in the 2050s than in the 2020s. According to climate change scenarios, temperature will increase in this region, with the 2050s experiencing much higher increases than the 2020s with a monthly temperature change range of 0\u20131.7 Â°C. The range of change in mean annual rainfall of 2.4\u201323.2\\% corresponded to a change in streamflow of about 6\u2013115\\%. The analysis revealed important rainfall\u2013runoff linear relationships for certain months that could be extrapolated to estimate amounts of streamflow under various scenarios of change in rainfall. Streamflow response was not sensitive to changes in temperature. If all other variables, e.g. land cover, population growth etc., were held constant, a significant increase in streamflow may be expected in the coming decades as a consequence of increased rainfall amounts.

In doing so, it approaches this particular challenge from a variety of different perspectives and theoretical frameworks. Analyzing the body of scholarly literature on climate change communication, this article critically reviews how communication is conceptualized in the literature and concludes that the field of climate change communication is characterized by diverging and incompatible understandings of communication as a theoretical construct. In some instances, communication theory appears reduced to an 'ad hoc' toolbox, from which theories are randomly picked to provide studies with a fitting framework. Inspired by the paradigm shift from transmission to interaction within communication theory, potential lessons from the field of communication theory are highlighted and discussed in the context of communicating climate change. Rooted in the interaction paradigm, the article proposes a meta-theoretical framework that conceptualizes communication as a constitutive process of producing and reproducing shared meanings. Rather than operating in separate ontological and epistemological perspectives, a meta-theoretical conceptualization of communication would ensure a common platform that advances multiperspective argumentation and discussion of the role of climate change communication in society.

The references cited therein were extracted and analyzed with regard to publications, which are cited most frequently. Second, a new method for establishing a more subject-specific publication set for applying RPYS (based on the co-citations of a marker reference) is proposed (RPYS-CO). The RPYS of the climate change literature focuses on the history of climate change research in total. We identified 35 highly-cited publications across all disciplines, which include fundamental early scientific works of the nineteenth century (with a weak connection to climate change) and some cornerstones of science with a stronger connection to climate change. By using the Arrhenius (Philos Mag J Sci Ser 5(41):237--276, 1896) paper as a RPYS-CO marker paper, we selected only publications specifically discussing the discovery of the greenhouse effect and the role of carbon dioxide. Using different RPYS approaches in this study, we were able to identify the complete range of works of the celebrated icons as well as many less known works relevant for the history of climate change research. The analyses confirmed the potential of the RPYS method for historical studies: Seminal papers are detected on the basis of the references cited by the overall community without any further assumptions.",

         "abstract": "The representation of the northern hemisphere (NH) storm tracks and jet streams and their response to climate change has been evaluated in climate model simulations from phases 3, 5 and 6 of the Couple Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6, respectively). The spatial patterns of the multi\u2010model biases in CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 are similar, however the magnitudes of the biases in the CMIP6 models are substantially lower. For instance, the multi\u2010model mean RMSE of the North Atlantic storm track for the CMIP6 models (as measured by time\u2010filtered sea\u2010level pressure variance) is over 50% smaller than that of the CMIP3 models in both winter and summer, and over 40% smaller for the North Pacific. The magnitude of the jet stream biases are also reduced in CMIP6, but by a lesser extent. Despite this improved representation of the current climate, the spatial patterns of the climate change response of the NH storm tracks and jet streams remain similar in the CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models. The SSP2\u20104.5 scenario responses in the CMIP6 models are substantially larger than in the RCP4.5 CMIP5 models, which is consistent with the larger climate sensitivities of the CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5.",

Because elements of biodiversity respond intimately to climate as an important driving force of distributional limitation2, distributional shifts and biodiversity losses are expected3, 4. Nevertheless, in spite of modelling efforts focused on single species2 or entire ecosystems5, a few preliminary surveys of fauna-wide effects6, 7, and evidence of climate change-mediated shifts in several species8, 9, the likely effects of climate change on species' distributions remain little known, and fauna-wide or community-level effects are almost completely unexplored6. Here, using a genetic algorithm and museum specimen occurrence data, we develop ecological niche models for 1,870 species occurring in Mexico and project them onto two climate surfaces modelled for 2055. Although extinctions and drastic range reductions are predicted to be relatively few, species turnover in some local communities is predicted to be high (>40% of species), suggesting that severe ecological perturbations may result.",

Based on expert judgement and an extensive literature database, we evaluate 306\u2009combinations of well-being outcomes and demand-side options, finding largely beneficial effects in improvement in well-being (79% positive, 18% neutral and 3% negative), even though we find low confidence on the social dimensions of well-being. Implementing such nuanced solutions is based axiomatically on an understanding of malleable rather than fixed preferences, and procedurally on changing infrastructures and choice architectures. Results demonstrate the high mitigation potential of demand-side mitigation options that are synergistic with well-being.",

         "abstract": "Observations1\u20133 and model simulations3,4 show enhanced warming in the Arctic under increasing greenhouse gases, a phenomenon known as the Arctic amplification (AA)5, that is likely caused by sea-ice loss1,3. AA reduces meridional temperature gradients linked to circulation, thus mid-latitude weather and climate changes have been attributed to AA, often on the basis of regression analysis and atmospheric simulations6\u201319. However, other modelling studies20\u201322 show only a weak link. This inconsistency may result from deficiencies in separating the effects of AA from those of natural variability or background warming. Here, using coupled model simulations with and without AA, we show that cold-season precipitation, snowfall and circulation changes over northern mid-latitudes come mostly from background warming. AA and sea-ice loss increase precipitation and snowfall above ~60Â°\u2009N and reduce meridional temperature gradients above ~45Â°\u2009N in the lower\u2013mid troposphere. However, minimal impact on the mean climate is seen below ~60Â°\u2009N, with weak reduction in zonal wind over 50Â°\u201370Â°\u2009N and 150\u2013700\u2009hPa, mainly over the North Atlantic and northern central Asia. These results suggest that the climatic impacts of AA are probably small outside the high latitudes, thus caution is needed in attributing mid-latitude changes to AA and sea-ice loss on the basis of statistical analyses that cannot distinguish the impact of AA from other correlated changes.",

We explore a new network approach based on Twitter data in which we compare author keywords to hashtags as indicators of topics. We analyze the topics of tweeted publications and compare them with the topics of all publications (tweeted and not tweeted). Our exploratory study is based on a comprehensive publication set of climate change research. We are interested in whether Twitter data are able to reveal topics of public discussions which can be separated from research-focused topics. We find that the most tweeted topics regarding climate change research focus on the consequences of climate change for humans. Twitter users are interested in climate change publications which forecast effects of a changing climate on the environment and to adaptation, mitigation and management issues rather than in the methodology of climate-change research and causes of climate change. Our results indicate that publications using scientific jargon are less likely to be tweeted than publications using more general keywords.

All models reproduce the general structures of the observed climatological storm-track pattern under present-day forcing conditions. Ensemble mean changes resulting from anthropogenic forcing include an increase of baroclinic wave activity over the eastern North Atlantic, amounting to 5\\%?8\\% by the end of the twenty-first century. Enhanced activity is also found over the Asian continent and over the North Pacific near the Aleutian Islands. At high latitudes and over parts of the subtropics, activity is reduced. Variations of the individual models around the ensemble average signal are not small, with a median of the pattern correlation near r = 0.5. There is, however, no evidence for a link between deviations in present-day climatology and deviations with respect to climate change.",

Therefore, adaptation, especially in the context of a changing climate and a resulting shift in the intensity and frequency of extreme events, is necessary. Thermal power plants are subject to a diversity of extreme weather impacts, making them vulnerable if not adapted. In this paper, the impacts of extreme weather events on thermal power plants are first identified and structured. Then selected adaptation options for thermal power plants are presented. Three major types of adaptation option are identified: adaptation of cooling, infrastructure, and sites. The Supplementary Material introduces a GIS-based (Geographic Information System) decision-support tool for power plant adaptation and planning.",

There also has been considerable progress in understanding of how to effectively communicate climate change. This progress raises questions about the future directions of communication research and practice. What more is there to say? Through a selective literature review, focused on contributions since a similar stock-taking exercise in 2010,1 the article delineates significant advances, emerging trends and topics, and tries to chart critical needs and opportunities going forward. It describes the climate communication landscape midway through the second decade of the 21st century to contextualize the challenges faced by climate change communication as a scientific field. Despite the important progress made on key scientific challenges laid out in 2010, persistent challenges remain (superficial public understanding of climate change, transitioning from awareness and concern to action, communicating in deeply politicized and polarized environments, and dealing with the growing sense of overwhelm and hopelessness). In addition, new challenges and topics have emerged that communication researchers and practitioners now face. The study reflects on the crucial need to improve the interaction between climate communication research and practice, and calls for dedicated science-practice boundary work focused on climate change communication. A set of new charges to climate communicators and researchers are offered in hopes to move climate change communication to a new place\u2014at once more humble yet also more ambitious than ever before, befitting to the crucial role it could play in the cultural work humanity faces with climate change.

However, in common with other renewables, it may be sensitive to changes in climate resulting from rising carbon emissions. Changes in wind patterns are widely anticipated, and this will ultimately alter wave regimes. Indeed, evidence indicates that wave heights have been changing over the last 40 years, although there is no proven link to global warming. Changes in the wave climate will affect wave energy conversion. Where the resource is restricted, there may be reductions in energy exports and, consequently, negative economic impacts. On the other hand, increased storm activity will increase installation survival risks. Here a study is presented that, for the first time, indicates the sensitivity of wave energy production and economics to changes in climate.",

To investigate the impacts of climate change on future European wind power generation potential, we analyze a multi-model ensemble of the most recent EURO-CORDEX regional climate simulations at the 12 km grid resolution. We developed a mid-century wind power plant scenario to focus the impact assessment on relevant locations for future wind power industry. We found that, under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, changes in the annual energy yield of the future European wind farms fleet as a whole will remain within Â±5\\% across the 21st century. At country to local scales, wind farm yields will undergo changes up to 15\\% in magnitude, according to the large majority of models, but smaller than 5\\% in magnitude for most regions and models. The southern fleets such as the Iberian and Italian fleets are likely to be the most affected. With regard to variability, changes are essentially small or poorly significant from subdaily to interannual time scales.",

         "volume": "7","number": "5","pages": "916--944","abstract": "Bioenergy deployment offers significant potential for climate change mitigation, but also carries considerable risks. In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land-use and energy experts, land-use and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life-cycle assessment experts. We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-the-art knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100Â EJ: high agreement; 100\u2013300Â EJ: medium agreement; above 300Â EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245Â EJÂ yrâ1 to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large-scale deployment (>200Â EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2Â° degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land-intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts. We conclude that the high variability in pathways, uncertainties in technological development and ambiguity in political decision render forecasts on deployment levels and climate effects very difficult. However, uncertainty about projections should not preclude pursuing beneficial bioenergy options.",

However, decision-makers lack guidance on how such rain-on-snow (ROS) flood risk may respond to climate change. Here, daily ROS events with flood-generating potential8 are simulated over western North America for a historical (2000\u20132013) and future (forced under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.59) period with the Weather Research and Forecasting model; 4\u2009km resolution allows the basin-scale ROS flood risk to be assessed. In the warmer climate, we show that ROS becomes less frequent at lower elevations due to snowpack declines, particularly in warmer areas (for example, the Pacific maritime region). By contrast, at higher elevations where seasonal snowcover persists, ROS becomes more frequent due to a shift from snowfall to rain. Accordingly, the water available for runoff10 increases for 55% of western North American river basins, with corresponding increases in flood risk of 20\u2013200%, the greatest changes of which are projected for the Sierra Nevada, the Colorado River headwaters and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Thus, flood control and water resource planning must consider ROS to fully quantify changes in flood risk with anthropogenic warming.",

         "volume": "29","number": "2","pages": "191--216","abstract": "The increasing demand by the scientific community, policy makers, and the public for realistic projections of possible regional impacts of future climate changes has rendered the issue of regional climate simulation critically important. The problem of projecting regional climate changes can be identified as that of representing effects of atmospheric forcings on two different spatial scales: large-scale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the general circulation and determine the sequence of weather events which characterize the climate regime of a given region (for example, greenhouse gas abundance), and mesoscale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the local circulations, thereby regulating the regional distribution of climatic variables (for example, complex mountainous systems). General circulation models (GCMs) are the main tools available today for climate simulation. However, they are run and will likely be run for the next several years at resolutions which are too coarse to adequately describe mesoscale forcings and yield accurate regional climate detail. This paper presents a review of these approaches. They can be divided in three broad categories: (1) Purely empirical approaches, in which the forcings are not explicitly accounted for, but regional climate scenarios are constructed by using instrumental data records or paleoclimatic analogues; (2) semiempirical approaches, in which GCMs are used to describe the atmospheric response to large-scale forcings of relevance to climate changes, and empirical techniques account for the effect of mesoscale forcings; and (3) modeling approaches, in which mesoscale forcings are described by increasing the model resolution only over areas of interest. Since they are computationally inexpensive, empirical and semiempirical techniques have been so far more widely used. Their application to regional climate change projection is, however, limited by their own empiricism and by the availability of data sets of adequate quality. More recently, a nested GCM-limited area model methodology for regional climate simulation has been developed, with encouraging preliminary results. As it is physically, rather than empirically, based, the nested modeling framework has a wide range of applications.",

There are three sets of results: (a) for IS92a (previously described as a 'business-as-usual' climate scenario); (b) for stabilization scenarios at 550 and 750 ppm and (c) for Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). The main conclusions are: (i) the region of greatest risk is Africa; (ii) stabilization at 750 ppm avoids some but not most of the risk, while stabilization at 550 ppm avoids most of the risk and (iii) the impact of climate change on risk of hunger is influenced greatly by pathways of development. For example, a SRES B2 development pathway is characterized by much lower levels of risk than A2; and this is largely explained by differing levels of income and technology not by differing amounts of climate forcing.",

We applied niche-based models to analyse the impact of climate change on tree species and functional diversity in Europe. Present-day climate was used to predict the distributions of 122 tree species from different functional types (FT). We then explored projections of future distributions under one climate scenario for 2080, considering two alternative dispersal assumptions: no dispersal and unlimited dispersal. The species-rich broadleaved deciduous group appeared to play a key role in the future of different European regions. Temperate areas were projected to lose both species richness and functional diversity due to the loss of broadleaved deciduous trees. These were projected to migrate to boreal forests, thereby increasing their species richness and functional diversity. Atlantic areas provided an intermediate case, with a predicted reduction in the numbers of species and occasional predicted gains in functional diversity. This resulted from a loss in species within the broadleaved deciduous FT, but overall maintenance of the group. Our results illustrate the fact that both species-specific predictions and functional patterns should be examined separately in order to assess the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and gain insights into future ecosystem functioning.",

The causation of undernutrition is complex, and there is a need to develop models that better quantify the potential impacts of climate change on population health. We developed a model for estimating future undernutrition that accounts for food and nonfood (socioeconomic) causes and can be linked to available regional scenario data. We estimated child stunting attributable to climate change in five regions in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2050. We used current national food availability and undernutrition data to parameterize and validate a global model, using a process-driven approach based on estimations of the physiological relationship between a lack of food and stunting. We estimated stunting in 2050 using published modeled national calorie availability under two climate scenarios and a reference scenario (no climate change). We estimated that climate change will lead to a relative increase in moderate stunting of 1-29\\% in 2050 compared with a future without climate change. Climate change will have a greater impact on rates of severe stunting, which we estimated will increase by 23\\% (central SSA) to 62\\% (South Asia). Climate change is likely to impair future efforts to reduce child malnutrition in South Asia and SSA, even when economic growth is taken into account. Our model suggests that to reduce and prevent future undernutrition, it is necessary to both increase food access and improve socioeconomic conditions, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",

This arises since it is not yet possible to accept the hypothesis that the series of maxima or of high level values are stationary, without at least verifying the assumption. Thus, in this paper, different approaches are tested and compared to derive high order RLs in the nonstationary context. These RLs are computed by extrapolating identified trends, and a bootstrap method is used to estimate confidence intervals. The identification of trends can be made either in the parameters of the extreme value distributions or in the mean and variance of the whole series. Then, a methodology is proposed to test if the trends in extremes can be explained by the trends in mean and variance of the whole dataset. If this is the case, the future extremes can be derived from the stationary extremes of the centered and normalized variable and the changes in mean and variance of the whole dataset. The RL can then be estimated as nonstationary or as stationary for fixed future periods. The work is done for both extreme value methods: block maxima and peak over threshold, and will be illustrated with the example of a long observation time series for daily maximum temperature in France.

In this study, we examine scenarios of changes in extreme precipitation events in 24 future climate runs of ten regional climate models, focusing on a specific area of the Czech Republic (central Europe) where complex orography and an interaction of other factors governing the occurrence of heavy precipitation events result in patterns that cannot be captured by global models. The peaks-over-threshold analysis with increasing threshold censoring is applied to estimate multi-year return levels of daily rainfall amounts. Uncertainties in scenarios of changes for the late 21st century related to the inter-model and within-ensemble variability and the use of the SRES-A2 and SRES-B2 greenhouse gas emission scenarios are evaluated. The results show that heavy precipitation events are likely to increase in severity in winter and (with less agreement among models) also in summer. The inter-model and intra-model variability and related uncertainties in the pattern and magnitude of the change is large, but the scenarios tend to agree with precipitation trends recently observed in the area, which may strengthen their credibility. In most scenario runs, the projected change in extreme precipitation in summer is of the opposite sign than a change in mean seasonal totals, the latter pointing towards generally drier conditions in summer. A combination of enhanced heavy precipitation amounts and reduced water infiltration capabilities of a dry soil may severely increase peak river discharges and flood-related risks in this region.",

Routine monitoring of airborne pollen, now undertaken on a near-global basis, could be adapted for this purpose. Analysis of spatial and seasonal variations in pollen levels in New Zealand suggests that the timing of onset and peak abundance of certain pollen taxa should be explored as possible bio-indicators of climate change. The onset of the airborne grass pollen season during the summer of 1988/89 varied consistently with latitude, and hence temperature, with the season in Southland commencing 8--9 days after Northland. However, these patterns were only apparent after sampling sites were separated into two groups reflecting predominantly urban or rural pollen sources. A less consistent north to south trend was apparent in the frequency of high (30 grains/m3) grass pollen levels, with high levels frequent in North Island localities in November, December and January and in southern localities during December and January. The successive onset of pollen seasons for the principal tree species during the spring-to-early summer warming interval may also be a useful bio-indicator of climate change. As well as assisting forecasts of the onset of the pollinosis season, these biogeographical patterns, reflecting climatic variation with latitude, suggest that routine aeropalynological monitoring might provide early signals of vegetation response to climate change. These conclusions are supported by recent investigations of long-term aeropalynological datasets in Europe that indicate earlier onset of pollen seasons in response to recent global warming.",

         "abstract": "(Hi-lighted box at the beginning of Executive Summary)\nThe climate projections generated in ENSEMBLES describe the world and Europe experiencing tangible,\nmeasurable climate change. As the century progresses the projected climate moves increasingly farther\naway from its current state, so that by 2100 the climate of Europe will be very different from today. Even\nunder a mitigation scenario, the climate of Europe during the next few decades is still calculated to depart\nsignificantly from that of the present.\nENSEMBLES results show how the impacts resulting from these climate changes, including changes in\nclimate mean, variability and extremes, affect all the systems and sectors studied. Adverse impacts increase\nin magnitude through time often exceeding critical system thresholds. Examples include impacts on health,\nwater resources, agriculture, energy supply and demand, and fire and pest risks to forests.\nMany of these new results reinforce the conclusions of earlier studies of climate change projections and\nimpacts. What is new about the ENSEMBLES results is that they describe in far greater detail how the\nclimate is expected to change under standard scenarios of future emissions. They also include, for the first\ntime, multi-model climate projections for a greenhouse gas mitigation scenario leading to emissions and\ntemperature stabilisation in line with European policy aims. The results have been used as a basis for a set\nof new tools and datasets for informing potential users about present and future climate, and have been\nlinked to new techniques for assessing the impacts of climate change in Europe in terms of risk.\nThis 'added value' in the ENSEMBLES results comes from using improved models, developing new and\nbetter techniques to analyse and disseminate projections of climate change and their uncertainties, and\ndemonstrating how this information can be applied in policy-relevant impact assessments. The\nimprovements for example, add skill to seasonal forecasting while multi-decadal models, for the first time,\nhave produced probabilistic climate change projections for Europe.",

A key assumption is that the climate sensitivity inferred today also applies to the distant future. Yet, global climate models robustly show that feedbacks vary over time, with a strong tendency for climate sensitivity to increase as equilibrium is approached9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Here I consider the implications of inconstant climate feedbacks for energy budget constraints on climate sensitivity. I find that the long-term value of climate sensitivity is, on average, 26\\% above that inferred during transient warming within global climate models, with a larger discrepancy when climate sensitivity is high. Moreover, model values of climate sensitivity inferred during transient warming are found to be consistent with energy budget observations1, 2, 3, indicating that the models are not overly sensitive. Using model-based estimates of how climate feedbacks will change in the future, in conjunction with recent energy budget constraints1, 19, produces a current best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.9\u2009Â°C (1.7\u20137.1\u2009Â°C, 90\\% confidence). These findings suggest that climate sensitivity estimated from global energy budget constraints is in agreement with values derived from other methods and simulated by global climate models.",

Climate models, supported by a growing body of observational data, have demonstrated that storm tracks shift poleward as the climate warms. But the dynamical mechanisms responsible for this shift remain unclear. To isolate what portion of the storm track shift may be accounted for by large-scale dry dynamics alone, disregarding the latent heat released in phase changes of water, this study investigates the storm track shift under various kinds of climate change in an idealized dry general circulation model (GCM) with an adjustable but constant convective stability. It is found that increasing the mean surface temperature or the convective stability leads to poleward shifts of storm tracks, even if the convective stability is increased only in a narrow band around the equator. Under warming and convective stability changes roughly corresponding to a doubling of CO2 concentrations from a present-day Earthlike climate, storm tracks shift about 0.8Â° poleward, somewhat less than but in qualitative agreement with studies using moist GCMs. About 63\\% (0.5Â°) of the poleward shift is shown to be caused by tropical convective stability variations. This demonstrates that tropical processes alone (the increased dry static stability of a warmer moist adiabat) can account for part of the poleward shift of storm tracks under global warming. This poleward shift generally occurs in tandem with a poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation; however, the Hadley circulation expansion does not always parallel the storm track shift.",

In recent years cities have begun to craft their own climate change responses against the backdrop of the reluctance displayed by nation-states in committing to emissions reductions and managing the consequences of climate change.\r\n\r\nClimate Change at the City Scale presents a fresh contribution to climate change literature, which has largely neglected the role of cities in spite of their increasingly important role in the global economy. The book focuses on the impacts of climate change in the rapidly evolving city of Cape Town, and captures the experiences of the Cape Town Climate Change Think Tank, a hybrid knowledge partnership which has produced research on a range of urban governance, impacts, mitigation and adaptation challenges by the City.\r\n\r\nCape Town has long been acknowledged as an innovator in the area of urban environmental management, notwithstanding its limited resources to manage the demand for a more resilient and equitable future. By documenting the work and experiences of the City\u2019s efforts to define its own climate future, the book provides a provocative case study of the way in which the science-policy interface can be managed to inform urban transformation.

Such complexity is repeated within government, as climate change cuts across traditional bureaucratic lines and challenges established ways of working.  Climate change therefore embodies many of the challenges associated with the governance narrative, highlighting the emergence of a fragmented and crowded policy arena.  Focusing on the British Government's intra-organizational response to climate change, this article will establish the relevance of the governance narrative to practice and experience within central government, and tease out the broader implications for state capacity.  Overall, the article will highlight the emergence of a 'governance cycle', as the unwillingness of government to fundamentally appraise the extent that its institutional structures are fit-for-purpose vis-a-vis the challenges of modern governance has rendered these challenges without adequate resolution, and therefore with the potential for future governance failure.",

         "volume": "268","pages": "146-155","abstract": "Multiple cropping systems have been widely used in China as smart strategies to address climate change to ensure that increasing food demand is met. In the context of climate warming, the climate-based boundaries of multiple cropping systems are moving northward, and the potential crop yield is projected to increase due to continuous cropping that will be possible with increased light and heat resources. However, increasing demands for crop water have further aggravated the severity of water shortages in Northern China. In this study, we determine the impacts of climate change on the double cropping system (DCS) in Northern China using the annual accumulated temperature above 0\u2009Â°C. The northern climate-based boundaries of the DCS have moved significantly northward and westward in Liaoning, Hebei, Gansu, Shaanxi and Shanxi Provinces. At the same time, the annual crop water requirement has increased by 198\u2013403\u2009mm in the planting areas sensitive to climate change areas where the cropping system can potentially be transformed from a single cropping system (SCS) to a DCS. The highest probability of water deficit exceedance was found during the winter wheat growing season. In addition, the difference in crop yields between the two planting patterns was analyzed using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model. The annual output per arable land unit in the potential DCS region, which benefited from the increase in winter crops, increased by 11.6\u201386.2% under different irrigation scenarios. The increase in crop production is related to irrigation. In the water-saving irrigation scenarios of Irrigation-Wheat (180\u2009mm for winter wheat critical growth periods) and Irrigation-Wheat & Maize (180\u2009mm for winter wheat critical growth periods and 50\u2009mm for maize sowing), the annual output reached approximately 74\u201380% of the potential high yield in the Full Irrigation scenario. Our research provides suggestions for adjusting planting patterns under climate change. In the future, it will be necessary to develop multiple cropping practices that include innovative water-saving techniques and breeding technologies.",

The three climate change scenarios were applied to a global data set of mean monthly temperatures and precipitation. The regression model, which incorporates mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation as input variables, was used to project plant functional type changes. Spatial patterns of change were analysed using a geographical information system.ResultsRelative abundance of C4 grasses were projected to increase >10% throughout most of the study region at the expense of C3 grasses. There were essentially no areas where C4 grasses decreased in abundance, and the areas with no change were largely the southern Great Plains and the Intermountain Basin and Range of North America. C3 grasses declined throughout with the exception of the north-western Great Plains of the US and Canada, and north central Argentina. Changes in shrub abundance were mixed with some increases in Patagonia and the desert regions of the south-western US; there were also some projected decreases, however, the locations varied across models.Main conclusionsThe projections made by our regression model were consistent with those of other more complex vegetation dynamics models. Changes in plant community composition in response to climate change may be substantial in certain areas and will probably lead to changes in water and nutrient cycling.",

It includes contributions from experts from around the globe whose research, advocacy, teaching, work, or service in the natural or social sciences deals with risk communication and/or management surrounding natural and technological disasters, with a particular focus on climate change-related phenomena. Resilience and good communication are intimately linked and with climate change precipitating more numerous and onerous weather-related catastrophes, a conversation on resilience is timely and necessary. The goal is robust communities that are able to withstand the shock of disaster. Communicating well under ordinary circumstances is challenging; communicating during a crisis is extraordinarily difficult.\n\nThis book is dedicated to all those who have directly or indirectly suffered the effects of climate change end extreme events with the hope that the advance of knowledge, implementation of sound science and appropriate policies and use of effective communication will help in reducing their vulnerability while also improving resilience in the face of often devastating natural and technological disasters.",

Here we provide an assessment of near-term climate change impacts on sorghum yields in West Africa and account for uncertainties both in future climate scenarios and in crop models. Towards this goal, we use simulations of nine bias-corrected CMIP5 climate models and two crop models (SARRA-H and APSIM) to evaluate the robustness of projected crop yield impacts in this area. In broad agreement with the full CMIP5 ensemble, our subset of bias-corrected climate models projects a mean warming of +2.8 Â°C in the decades of 2031\u20132060 compared to a baseline of 1961\u20131990 and a robust change in rainfall in West Africa with less rain in the Western part of the Sahel (Senegal, South-West Mali) and more rain in Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, South-West Niger). Projected rainfall deficits are concentrated in early monsoon season in the Western part of the Sahel while positive rainfall changes are found in late monsoon season all over the Sahel, suggesting a shift in the seasonality of the monsoon. In response to such climate change, but without accounting for direct crop responses to CO 2 , mean crop yield decreases by about 16\u201320\\% and year-to-year variability increases in the Western part of the Sahel, while the eastern domain sees much milder impacts. Such differences in climate and impacts projections between the Western and Eastern parts of the Sahel are highly consistent across the climate and crop models used in this study. We investigate the robustness of impacts for different choices of cultivars, nutrient treatments, and crop responses to CO 2 . Adverse impacts on mean yield and yield variability are lowest for modern cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes. Easing nitrogen stress via increasing fertilizer inputs would increase absolute yields, but also make the crops more responsive to climate stresses, thus enhancing the negative impacts of climate change in a relative sense. Finally, CO 2  fertilization would significantly offset the negative climate impacts on sorghum yields by about 10\\%, with drier regions experiencing the largest benefits, though the net impacts of climate change remain negative even after accounting for CO 2 .",

Norte derived waves are less energetic than the devastating waves from tropical cyclones, but more frequent (~ 22 events/year) and with larger spatial influence. Despite their importance, few studies characterize Nortes derived waves and assess the effects of climate change on their occurrence. This study presents a method to identify and characterize Nortes with relation to their derived waves in the Gulf of Mexico. We based the identification of Nortes on synoptic measurements of pressure differences between Yucatan and Texas and wind speed at different buoy locations in the Gulf of Mexico. Subsequently, we identified the events in the CFSR reanalysis (present climate) and the CNRM-M5 model for the present climate and the RCP 8.5 scenario. We then forced a wave model to characterize the wave power generated by each event, followed by a principal component analysis and classification by k-means clustering analysis. Five different Nortes types were identified, each one representing a characteristic intensity and area of influence of the Norte driven waves. Finally, we estimated the occurrence of each Norte type for the present and future climates, where the CNRM-M5 results indicate that the high-intensity events will be less frequent in a warming climate, while mild events will become more frequent. The consequences of such changes may provide relief for maritime and coastal operations because of reduced downtimes. This result is particularly relevant for the operational design of coastal and marine facilities. Â© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

We then describe a pan-Arctic quantitative index of species sensitivity to climate change based on population size, geographic range, habitat specificity, diet diversity, migration, site fidelity, sensitivity to changes in sea ice, sensitivity to changes in the trophic web, and maximum population growth potential (R(max)). The index suggests three types of sensitivity based on: (1) narrowness of distribution and specialization in feeding, (2) seasonal dependence on ice, and (3) reliance on sea ice as a structure for access to prey and predator avoidance. Based on the index, the hooded seal, the polar bear, and the narwhal appear to be the three most sensitive Arctic marine mammal species, primarily due to reliance on sea ice and specialized feeding. The least sensitive species were the ringed seal and bearded seal, primarily due to large circumpolar distributions, large population sizes, and flexible habitat requirements. The index provides an objective framework for ranking species and focusing future research on the effects of climate change on Arctic marine mammals. Finally, we distinguish between highly sensitive species and good indicator species and discuss regional variation and species-specific ecology that confounds Arctic-wide generalization regarding the effects of climate change.",

Pollen is an important trigger of some types of asthma, and both pollen quantity and season depend on climatic and meteorologic variables. Over the same period as the global rise in asthma, there have been considerable increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and global average surface temperature. We hypothesize anthropogenic climate change as a plausible contributor to the rise in asthma. Greater concentrations of carbon dioxide and higher temperatures may increase pollen quantity and induce longer pollen seasons. Pollen allergenicity can also increase as a result of these changes in climate. Exposure in early life to a more allergenic environment may also provoke the development of other atopic conditions, such as eczema and allergic rhinitis. Although the etiology of asthma is complex, the recent global rise in asthma could be an early health effect of anthropogenic climate change.",

It is hoped that the advice will stimulate planners to look for new strategies to respond to the changing climate in partnership with developers and the wider community. The advice centers on five themes: (1) Act Now, (2) Make the Links, (3) Spread the Word, (4) Make the best use of existing tools, and (5) Make effective use of existing instruments.",

It is therefore vital to understand how to communicate scientific information most effectively to this group1. We tested how a unique sample of policymakers and negotiators at the Paris COP21 conference update their beliefs on year 2100 global mean temperature increases in response to a statistical summary of climate models' forecasts. We randomized the way information was provided across participants using three different formats similar to those used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports2, 3. In spite of having received all available relevant scientific information, policymakers adopted such information very conservatively, assigning it less weight than their own prior beliefs. However, providing individual model estimates in addition to the statistical range was more effective in mitigating such inertia. The experiment was repeated with a population of European MBA students who, despite starting from similar priors, reported conditional probabilities closer to the provided models' forecasts than policymakers. There was also no effect of presentation format in the MBA sample. These results highlight the importance of testing visualization tools directly on the population of interest.",

Future climate projections from five global circulation models (GCMs) under the four IPCC emission scenarios were fed into an existing SWAT hydrological model to project the impact on different components of water resources across the African continent. The GCMs have been downscaled based on observed data of Climate Research Unit to represent local climate conditions at 0.5Â° grid spatial resolution. The results show that for Africa as a whole, the mean total quantity of water resources is likely to increase. For individual subbasins and countries, variations are substantial. Although uncertainties are high in the simulated results, we found that in many regions/countries, most of the climate scenarios projected the same direction of changes in water resources, suggesting a relatively high confidence in the projections. The assessment of the number of dry days and the frequency of their occurrences suggests an increase in the drought events and their duration in the future. Overall, the dry regions have higher uncertainties than the wet regions in the projected impacts on water resources. This poses additional challenge to the agriculture in dry regions where water shortage is already severe while irrigation is expected to become more important to stabilize and increase food production.

We use two future scenarios \u2013 the IPCC SRES A1B scenario, and a climate stabilisation scenario (2C20), allowing us to assess the impact of climate mitigation on results. We performed a pair of simulations under each scenario \u2013 one in which vegetation was fixed at the initial state and one in which vegetation changes dynamically in response to climate change, as determined by the interactive vegetation model within HadCM3C. <br><br> In our simulations with interactive vegetation, relatively small changes in global vegetation coverage were found, mainly dominated by increases in shrub and needleleaf trees at high latitudes and losses of broadleaf trees and grasses across the Amazon. Globally this led to a loss of terrestrial carbon, mainly from the soil. Global changes in carbon storage were related to the regional losses from the Amazon and gains at high latitude. Regional differences in carbon storage between the two scenarios were largely driven by the balance between warming-enhanced decomposition and altered vegetation growth. Globally, interactive vegetation reduced albedo acting to enhance albedo changes due to climate change. This was mainly related to the darker land surface over high latitudes (due to vegetation expansion, particularly during December\u2013January and March\u2013May); small increases in albedo occurred over the Amazon. As a result, there was a relatively small impact of vegetation change on most global annual mean climate variables, which was generally greater under A1B than 2C20, with markedly stronger local-to-regional and seasonal impacts. Globally, vegetation change amplified future annual temperature increases by 0.24 and 0.15 K (under A1B and 2C20, respectively) and increased global precipitation, with reductions in precipitation over the Amazon and increases over high latitudes. In general, changes were stronger over land \u2013 for example, global temperature changes due to interactive vegetation of 0.43 and 0.28 K under A1B and 2C20, respectively. Regionally, the warming influence of future vegetation change in our simulations was driven by the balance between driving factors. For instance, reduced tree cover over the Amazon reduced evaporation (particularly during June\u2013August), outweighing the cooling influence of any small albedo changes. In contrast, at high latitudes the warming impact of reduced albedo (particularly during December\u2013February and March\u2013May) due to increased vegetation cover appears to have offset any cooling due to small evaporation increases. <br><br> Climate mitigation generally reduced the impact of vegetation change on future global and regional climate in our simulations. Our study therefore suggests that there is a need to consider both biogeochemical and biophysical effects in climate adaptation and mitigation decision making.",

However, this routine demotivates many librarians who have the potential and enthusiasm to make an impact on national development. Climate change is one of the most challenging global occurrences. It greatly affects many developmental activities such as agriculture, on which over 80% of Uganda\u2019s population thrives. The aim of this paper is to assess and recommend innovative ways through which librarians can practically participate in the mitigation of climate change effects in the country in addition to information dissemination. The study used a cross-sectional survey of librarians in Uganda and realised a response rate of 95.5%, with most respondents from academic institutions and their primary role mainly (83.7%) as librarians. It was established that the majority (55.8%) was aware of the 2030 United Nations (UN) Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Also observed was that air pollution, toxic pollutants and deforestation are the key causes of environmental degradation in Uganda. Librarians should be repositioned to promote products and services which assist in reducing waste as well as promoting awareness campaigns for waste reduction and education. This initiative, however, is expected to be affected by challenges such as poverty and the subsistence needs of the communities as well as conflicting priorities of the people and government.",

The purpose of this book is to help the climatologist understand the basic precepts of the statistician's art and to provide some of the background needed to apply statistical methodology correctly and usefully. The book is self contained: introductory material, standard advanced techniques, and the specialised techniques used specifically by climatologists are all contained within this one source. There are a wealth of real-world examples drawn from the climate literature to demonstrate the need, power and pitfalls of statistical analysis in climate research. Suitable for graduate courses on statistics for climatic, atmospheric and oceanic science, this book will also be valuable as a reference source for researchers in climatology, meteorology, atmospheric science, and oceanography.",

Due to a possible weakening of the North Atlantic Current, it is difficult to predict whether the climate in the Faroe Islands will be warmer or colder as a result of global warming. Therefore, two scenarios are proposed. The first scenario assumes an increase in summer and winter temperature of 2 oC, and the second a decrease in summer and winter temperature of 2 oC. Location Temperate, low alpine and alpine areas in the northern and central part of the Faroe Islands. Methods The responses of 12 different plant species in the Faroe Islands were tested against measured soil temperature, expressed as Tmin, Tmax, snow cover and growing degree days (GDD), using generalised linear modelling (GLM). Results The tolerance to changes in winter soil temperature (0.3-0.8 oC) was found to be lower than the tolerance to changing summer soil temperature (0.7-1.0 oC), and in both cases lower than the predicted climate changes. Conclusions The species most affected by a warming scenario are those that are found with a limited distribution restricted to the uppermost parts of the mountains, especially Salix herbacea, Racomitrium fasciculare, and Bistorta vivipara. For other species, the effect will mainly be a general upward migration. The most vulnerable species are those with a low tolerance, especially Calluna vulgaris, and also Empetrum nigrum, and Nardus stricta. If the climate in the Faroe Islands should become colder, the most vulnerable species are those at low altitudes. A significantly lower temperature would be expected to produce a serious reduction in the extent of Vaccinium myrtillus and Galium saxatilis. Species like Empetrum nigrum, Nardus stricta, and Calluna vulgaris may also be vulnerable. In any case, these species can be expected to migrate downwards.",

However, the relative scarcity of species on mountains in oceanic areas of south-western Norway and the Scottish Highland is considered partly to be due to the effect of mild winter temperatures (Dahl, 1990; Crawford, 2001). In Norway, these species, absent from mountainous areas, are described as south-west coast avoiders (Dahl, 1951, 1990).",

         "volume": "14","number": "1","pages": "53--67","abstract": "This paper analyses the global consequences to crop yields, production, and risk of hunger of linked socio-economic and climate scenarios. Potential impacts of climate change are estimated for climate change scenarios developed from the HadCM3 global climate model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1FI, A2, B1, and B2. Projected changes in yield are calculated using transfer functions derived from crop model simulations with observed climate data and projected climate change scenarios. The basic linked system (BLS) is used to evaluate consequent changes in global cereal production, cereal prices and the number of people at risk from hunger. The crop yield results elucidate the complex regional patterns of projected climate variables, CO2 effects, and agricultural systems that contribute to aggregations of global crop production. The A1FI scenario, as expected with its large increase in global temperatures, exhibits the greatest decreases both regionally and globally in yields, especially by the 2080s. The contrast between the yield change in developed and developing countries is largest under the A2a\u2013c scenarios. Under the B1 and B2 scenarios, developed and developing countries exhibit less contrast in crop yield changes, with the B2 future crop yield changes being slightly more favourable than those of the B1 scenario. When crop yield results are introduced to the BLS world food trade system model, the combined model and scenario experiments demonstrate that the world, for the most part, appears to be able to continue to feed itself under the SRES scenarios during the rest of this century. However, this outcome is achieved through production in the developed countries (which mostly benefit from climate change) compensating for declines projected, for the most part, for developing nations. While global production appears stable, regional differences in crop production are likely to grow stronger through time, leading to a significant polarisation of effects, with substantial increases in prices and risk of hunger amongst the poorer nations, especially under scenarios of greater inequality (A1FI and A2). The use of the SRES scenarios highlights several non-linearities in the world food supply system, both in the biophysical sense, where the levels of atmospheric CO2 tested reach new levels, and the socio-economic sense, where changes in population dynamics and economic and political structures complicate the translation of biophysical climate change impacts into social indices, such as the number of people at risk of hunger.",

Studies on the effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still lacking and current knowledge is provided by epidemiological and experimental studies on the relationship between asthma and environmental factors, such as meteorological variables, airborne allergens and air pollution. However, there is also considerable evidence that subjects affected by asthma are at an increased risk of developing obstructive airway exacerbations with exposure to gaseous and particulate components of air pollution. It is not easy to evaluate the impact of climate change and air pollution on the prevalence of asthma in general and on the timing of asthma exacerbations. However, the global rise in asthma prevalence and severity suggests that air pollution and climate changes could be contributing. Pollen allergy is frequently used to study the interrelationship between air pollution, rhinitis and bronchial asthma. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that urbanization, high levels of vehicle emissions and westernized lifestyle are correlated to an increase in the frequency of pollen-induced respiratory allergy, prevalent in people who live in urban areas compared with those who live in rural areas. Meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.) along with their climatological regimes (warm or cold anomalies and dry or wet periods, etc.), can affect both biological and chemical components of this interaction. In addition, by inducing airway inflammation, air pollution overcomes the mucosal barrier priming allergen-induced responses. In conclusion, climate change might induce negative effects on respiratory allergic diseases. In particular, the increased length and severity of the pollen season, the higher occurrence of heavy precipitation events and the increasing frequency of urban air pollution episodes suggest that environmental risk factors will have a stronger effect in the following decades.",

So far, most studies dealt with individual model results. In the present analysis, we refer to 79 coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere simulations from 12 different climate models under 6 different IPCC scenarios. The basic question is as to what extent various state-of-the-art climate models agree in predicting changes in the main features of El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the monsoon climates in South Asia and West Africa. The individual model runs are compared with observational data in order to judge whether the spatio-temporal characteristics of ENSO are well reproduced. The model experiments can be grouped into multi-model ensembles. Thus, climate change signals in the classical index time series, in the principal components and in the time series of interannual variability can be evaluated against the background of internal variability and model uncertainty. There are large differences between the individual model predictions until the end of the 21st century, especially in terms of monsoon rainfall and the Southern Oscillation index (SOI). The majority of the models tends to project La NiÃ±a-like anomalies in the SOI and an intensification of the summer monsoon precipitation in India and West Africa. However, the response barely exceeds the level of natural variability and the systematic intermodel variations are larger than the impact of different IPCC scenarios. Nonetheless, there is one prominent climate change signal, which stands out from model variations and internal noise: All forced model experiments agree in predicting a substantial warming in the eastern tropical Pacific. This oceanic heating does not necessarily lead to a modification of ENSO towards more frequent El NiÃ±o and/or La NiÃ±a events. It simply represents a change in the background state of ENSO. Indeed, we did not find convincing multi-model evidence for a modification of the wavelet spectra in terms of ENSO or the monsoons. Some models suggest an intensification of the annual cycle but this signal is fairly model-dependent. Thus, large model uncertainty still exists with respect to the future behaviour of climate in the low latitudes. This has to be taken into account when addressing climate change signals in individual model experiments and ensembles.",

On the other hand a biome or  \u201D rule-based\u201D model, in this case the BIOME model, which allows for the determination of the occurrence of a specific biome type from a given climatic situation assuming equilibrium conditions. Within the FBM prognosis net primary production and TCC are reduced both for needle leaved and broad leaved forests if the CO2-fertilisation effect is not taken into account. When the CO2-fertilisation effect is taken into consideration NPP, standing biomass and soil carbon are increased in a future greenhouse climate. Although there is a considerable shift of the biomes in response to the greenhouse climate within the BIOME approach, the TCC in the investigated northern biomes stayed more or less constant. This is due to a decrease in biomass in the southern regions of today's temperate forests compensating the biomass increase by the northward shift of the taiga border.",

This species is vulnerable to extinction and has shown striking range retractions in recent decades, withdrawing broadly from southern portions of its historical distribution. Its range reduction has generally been attributed to the effects of habitat loss; however, as this species has also disappeared from large forested areas, consideration of other factors that may act in concert is merited.LocationÂ  Historical distribution of the blue-winged macaw in Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northern Argentina.MethodsÂ  We used a correlative approach to test a hypothesis of causation of observed shifts by reduction of habitable areas mediated by climate change. We developed models of the ecological niche requirements of the blue-winged macaw, based on point-occurrence data and climate scenarios for pre-1950 and post-1950 periods, and tested model predictivity for anticipating geographical distributions within time periods. Then we projected each model to the other time period and compared distributions predicted under both climate scenarios to assess shifts of habitable areas across decades and to evaluate an explanation for observed range retractions.ResultsÂ  Differences between predicted distributions of the blue-winged macaw over the twentieth century were, in general, minor and no change in suitability of landscapes was predicted across large areas of the species' original range in different time periods. No tendency towards range retraction in the south was predicted, rather conditions in the southern part of the species' range tended to show improvement for the species.Main conclusionsÂ  Our test permitted elimination of climate change as a likely explanation for the observed shifts in the distribution of the blue-winged macaw, and points rather to other causal explanations (e.g. changing regional land use, emerging diseases).",

Calculations suggest that ozone changes resulting from climate change only are negative in a large fraction of the troposphere because of enhanced photochemical destruction by water vapor. In the Tropics, increased lightning activity should lead to larger ozone concentrations. The magnitude of the climate-induced ozone changes in the troposphere remains smaller than the changes produced by enhanced anthropogenic emissions when the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2P is adopted to describe the future evolution of these emissions. Predictions depend strongly on future trends in atmospheric methane levels, which are not well established.

Taken separately, each approach faces methodological, spatial, and temporal limitations that potentially constrain the generality of results and predictions. Integration of the two approaches within a single study can overcome some of those limitations and provide ways to distinguish among consistent, dynamic, and context-dependent ecosystem responses to global warming. A simple conceptual model and two case studies that focus on climate change impacts on flowering phenology and carbon cycling in a subalpine meadow ecosystem illustrate the utility of this type of integration.",

The causes for such a decline are not completely understood; however, climate change has been identified as a possible cause for amphibian extinction, among others. Ecological niche modeling has proven to be a useful tool to predict potential distribution of species in the context of climatic changes. In this paper, we used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) to model the potential distributions of two species of plethodontid salamanders: Pseudoeurycea cephalica and P. leprosa. We projected their potential distributions under climatic scenarios expected in 50 yr based on a conservative scenario of global climate change and assuming a moderate dispersal ability for both species. Our analyses suggest that climate change effects may pose an additional long-term risk to both species of plethodontid salamanders, with a more dramatic scenario in the case of P. leprosa. By the year 2050, this species may lose almost 75 percent of its distributional area, and this projection is even worse when deforestation (in the way it is occurring at present) is considered within the predicted model. Our results concur with those obtained for species with limited dispersal capability because they do not track changing climates, but rather face a loss of distributional area. The survival of these species is not secure, even though their potential distributional area falls within a considerable number of natural protected areas. El declive de las poblaciones de anfibios a nivel mundial es un hecho bien documentado. Diversos factores se han identificado como las causas del declive, y entre ellos, el cambio climÃ¡tico se ha seÃ±alado como un factor importante en la extinciÃ³n de poblaciones de anfibios. El modelado de nicho ecolÃ³gico ha demostrado ser una herramienta Ãºtil para predecir la distribuciÃ³n potencial de las especies en el contexto del cambio climÃ¡tico global. En el presente trabajo utilizamos el algoritmo GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction) para modelar la distribuciÃ³n de dos especies de salamandras pletodÃ³ntidas: Pseudoerycea cephalica and P. leprosa; asimismo, proyectamos su distribuciÃ³n potencial bajo escenarios de cambio climÃ¡tico esperados que ocurran en 50 aÃ±os, basÃ¡ndonos en un escenario de cambio global conservativo y asumiendo una capacidad de dispersiÃ³n moderada para ambas especies de salamandras. Nuestros anÃ¡lisis sugieren que el cambio climÃ¡tico puede representar un riesgo adicional para ambas especies, siendo el escenario aÃºn mÃ¡s dramÃ¡tico para el caso de P. leprosa. Para el aÃ±o 2050, podrÃ­amos esperar que esta especie perdiera alrededor del 75 por ciento de su Ã¡rea de distribuciÃ³n y si consideramos la deforestaciÃ³n (tal como ocurre en el presente), la proyecciÃ³n serÃ­a aÃºn mÃ¡s desoladora. Nuestros resultados concuerdan con aquellos obtenidos en especies con una capacidad de dispersiÃ³n limitada dado que Ã©stas no responden a los cambios climÃ¡ticos desplazÃ¡ndose a zonas mÃ¡s favorables, sino que enfrentan una pÃ©rdida de su Ã¡rea de distribuciÃ³n. La supervivencia de estas especies de salamandra estÃ¡ en riesgo, sin embargo el Ã¡rea de distribuciÃ³n potencial estÃ¡ comprendida dentro de un nÃºmero considerable de ï¿½?reas Naturales Protegidas.",

An analysis of climate risks for crops in 12 food-insecure regions was conducted to identify adaptation priorities, based on statistical crop models and climate projections for 2030 from 20 general circulation models. Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food-insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions.",

This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the \"dust bowl'' era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding approximate to 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.",

The main objective of the PRUDENCE project was to provide high resolution climate change scenarios for Europe at the end of the twenty-first century by means of dynamical downscaling (regional climate modelling) of global climate simulations. The first part of the issue comprises seven overarching PRUDENCE papers on: (1) the design of the model simulations and analyses of climate model performance, (2 and 3) evaluation and intercomparison of simulated climate changes, (4 and 5) specialised analyses of impacts on water resources and on other sectors including agriculture, ecosystems, energy, and transport, (6) investigation of extreme weather events and (7) implications of the results for policy. A paper summarising the related MICE (Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes) project is also included. The second part of the issue contains 12 articles that focus in more detail on some of the themes summarised in the overarching papers. The PRUDENCE results represent the first comprehensive, continental-scale intercomparison and evaluation of high resolution climate models and their applications, bringing together climate modelling, impact research and social sciences expertise on climate change.",

Using a qualitative methodology based on an analysis of interviews and documents, the article sets out the three ideal-typical strategies of unions towards climate change mitigation policies: opposition, hedging and support. Our analysis finds that current trade union strategies on climate change are primarily rooted in sectoral interests mediated by union identities and conceptions of union democracy. At a theoretical level, the article contributes to broader debates on interest representation and collective bargaining behaviour by trade unions, in particular to the much-discussed tendency of organized groups to pursue private gains at the expense of common goods.",

Since the assessment was completed, output from another model has been added to the dataset, so the participation is now 17 groups from 12 countries with 24 models. This effort, as well as the subsequent analysis phase, was organized by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Working Group on Coupled Models (WGCM) Climate Simulation Panel, and constitutes the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). The dataset is called the WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset, and represents the largest and most comprehensive international global coupled climate model experiment and multimodel analysis effort ever attempted. As of March 2007, the Program for Climate Model Diagnostics and Intercomparison (PCMDI) has collected, archived, and served roughly 32 TB of model data. With oversight from the panel, the multimodel data were made openly available from PCMDI for analysis and academic applications. Over 171 TB of data had been downloaded among the more than 1000 registered users to date. Over 200 journal articles, based in part on the dataset, have been published so far. Though initially aimed at the IPCC AR4, this unique and valuable resource will continue to be maintained for at least the next several years. Never before has such an extensive set of climate model simulations been made available to the international climate science community for study. The ready access to the multimodel dataset opens up these types of model analyses to researchers, including students, who previously could not obtain state-of-the-art climate model output, and thus represents a new era in climate change research. As a direct consequence, these ongoing studies are increasing the body of knowledge regarding our understanding of how the climate system currently works, and how it may change in the future.",

New allergenic pollen types might appear in the Netherlands, like common ragweed and olive, which result in allergy patients developing allergies that scarcely occur in the Netherlands at present. Trees, such as birches and planes, might produce larger quantities of pollen, which could result in more severe symptoms. The pollen season might become longer thereby extending the period in which patients suffer from allergy symptoms. This extension of the pollen season could be due to a prolonged flowering period of certain species, e.g. grasses, or the appearance of new species that flower in late summer, e.g. common ragweed. Climate change could cause an increase in heavy thunderstorms on summer days in the grass pollen season, which are known to increase the chance of asthma exacerbations.",

Significant progress has been made in elucidating the magnitude and physical origins of present-day unforced GMST variability, but it has remained unclear how such variability may change as the climate warms. Here we present modelling evidence that indicates that the magnitude of low-frequency GMST variability is likely to decline in a warmer climate and that its generating mechanisms may be fundamentally altered. In particular, a warmer climate results in lower albedo at high latitudes, which yields a weaker albedo feedback on unforced GMST variability. These results imply that unforced GMST variability is dependent on the background climatological conditions, and thus climate model control simulations run under perpetual pre-industrial conditions may have only limited relevance for understanding the unforced GMST variability of the future.",

However, the total precipitation in an event also depends on the condensation rate, precipitation efficiency, and duration. Here, a new approach following an \u201Cingredients-based methodology\u201D from severe weather forecasting identifies important aspects of the heavy precipitation response to climate change, relevant from an impacts perspective and hitherto largely neglected. Using 2.2 km climate simulations, we show that a future increase in precipitation extremes across Europe occurs, not only because of higher moisture and updraft velocities, but also due to slower storm movement, increasing local duration. Environments with extreme precipitation potential are 7Ã more frequent than today by 2100, while the figure for quasi-stationary ones is 11Ã (14Ã for land). We find that a future reduction in storm speeds, possibly through Arctic Amplification, could enhance event accumulations and flood risk beyond expectations from studies focusing on precipitation rates.",

         "abstract": "The ongoing emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is triggering changes in many climate hazards that can impact humanity. We found traceable evidence for 467 pathways by which human health, water, food, economy, infrastructure and security have been recently impacted by climate hazards such as warming, heatwaves, precipitation, drought, floods, fires, storms, sea-level rise and changes in natural land cover and ocean chemistry. By 2100, the world\u2019s population will be exposed concurrently to the equivalent of the largest magnitude in one of these hazards if emmisions are aggressively reduced, or three if they are not, with some tropical coastal areas facing up to six simultaneous hazards. These findings highlight the fact that GHG emissions pose a broad threat to humanity by intensifying multiple hazards to which humanity is vulnerable.",

The extreme value models are applied to estimate 20-yr return values of maximum daily temperature over Europe in transient global climate model (GCM) simulations for the 21st century. A comparison of scenarios of changes in the 20-yr return temperatures based on the non-stationary peaks-over-threshold models with conventional stationary models is performed. It is demonstrated that the application of the stationary extreme value models in temperature data from GCM scenarios yields results that may be to a large extent biased, while the non-stationary models lead to spatial patterns that are robust and enable one to detect areas where the projected warming in the tail of the distribution of daily temperatures is largest. The method also allows splitting the projected warming of extremely high quantiles into two parts that reflect change in the location and scale of the distribution of extremes, respectively. Spatial patterns of the two components differ significantly in the examined climate change projections over Europe.",

Simulations from a regional climate model (PRECIS) were used with a crop model (GLAM) to examine crop growth under simulated current (1961\u20131990) and future (2071\u20132100) climates. Two processes were examined: the response of crop duration to mean temperature and the response of seed-set to extremes of temperature. The relative importance of, and interaction between, these two processes was examined for a number of genotypic characteristics, which were represented by using different values of crop model parameters derived from experiments. The impact of mean and extreme temperatures varied geographically, and depended upon the simulated genotypic properties. High temperature stress was not a major determinant of simulated yields in the current climate, but affected the mean and variability of yield under climate change in two regions which had contrasting statistics of daily maximum temperature. Changes in mean temperature had a similar impact on mean yield to that of high temperature stress in some locations and its effects were more widespread. Where the optimal temperature for development was exceeded, the resulting increase in duration in some simulations fully mitigated the negative impacts of extreme temperatures when sufficient water was available for the extended growing period. For some simulations the reduction in mean yield between the current and future climates was as large as 70\\%, indicating the importance of genotypic adaptation to changes in both means and extremes of temperature under climate change.",

The necessary ecological forecasting calls for ecosystem-based models capable of integrating multiple drivers across trophic levels and properly including uncertainty. The methodology presented here assesses the combined impacts of climate and fishing on marine food-web dynamics and provides estimates of the confidence envelope of the forecasts. It is applied to cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea, which is vulnerable to climate-related decline in salinity owing to both direct and indirect effects (i.e. through species interactions) on early-life survival. A stochastic food web-model driven by regional climate scenarios is used to produce quantitative forecasts of cod dynamics in the twenty-first century. The forecasts show how exploitation would have to be adjusted in order to achieve sustainable management under different climate scenarios.",

The interacting effects of carbon dioxide (ambient aCO2 \\~380 ppm, elevated eCO2 \\~550 ppm), water supply (RainFed, irrigated) and higher temperatures during grain filling on plant growth, grain yield and yield components were investigated. Overall, above ground total plant dry mass (DM) increased by 25\\% at eCO2. The responsiveness to eCO2 was varied during plant development, on an average 25, 19 and 31\\% (Pâ¤0.05) at tillering (DC30), anthesis (DC65) and maturity (DC90), respectively. Large interspecific variation in growth and yield response to elevated CO2 were observed, cultivar Zebu showed the highest grain yield stimulation eCO2 . Across all the treatments, grain yield was increased by 30\\% at eCO2. Increase in grain yield at eCO2 was partly due to an increase in tiller number at maturity (16\\%), single grain weight (9\\%) and kernels per spike (6\\%) by eCO2.",

Regional climate model simulations are used to isolate and diagnose the role of interactions between vegetation and\n                     the dynamics of the West African summer monsoon in generating abrupt climate change. Simulations with both fixed and interactive\n                     vegetation distributions are included. The modeled climate is largely insensitive to the latitude of the desert border when\n                     the border is located south of 17.9Â°N. But when the desert border is located only 180 km north of 17.9Â°N, the climate is quite\n                     sensitive, with summer precipitation rates a factor of 5 greater over the Sahara desert and an African easterly jet that is\n                     50\\% weaker. Prescribing vegetation north of the threshold latitude places moist soil beneath the thermal low, increasing the\n                     low-level moist static energy and convective instability. The atmospheric model is asynchronously coupled with a simple vegetation\n                     model that allows the vegetation to respond to and influence climate. When the model is initialized with the desert border\n                     at 10.0Â°N, the resulting equilibrium vegetation distribution is similar to that of the present day. In contrast, when the\n                     model is initialized with the desert border at 20.9Â°N, a new equilibrium vegetation distribution results in which the central\n                     Sahara is vegetated. The existence of these two stable climate and vegetation states and the threshold latitude indicates\n                     that interactions between vegetation (specifically through soil moisture) and the atmosphere (through the African easterly\n                     jet) can produce abrupt climate change.",

This model, HadGEM2-ES, allows us to assess the impacts of climate change, multiple interactions, and feedbacks as the model is run. This paper discusses the results of century-scale HadGEM2-ES simulations from an impacts perspective\u2013specifically, terrestrial ecosystems and water resources\u2013for four different scenarios following the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), being used for next assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Over the 21st Century, simulated changes in global and continential-scale terrestrial ecosystems due to climate change appear to be very similar in all 4 RCPs, even though the level of global warming by the end of the 21st Century ranges from 2 Â°C in the lowest scenario to 5.5Â° in the highest. A warming climate generally favours broadleaf trees over needleleaf, needleleaf trees over shrubs, and shrubs over herbaceous vegetation, resulting in a poleward shift of temperate and boreal forests and woody tundra in all scenarios. Although climate related changes are slightly larger in scenarios of greater warming, the largest differences between scenarios arise at regional scales as a consequence of different patterns of anthropogenic land cover change. In the model, the scenario with the lowest global warming results in the most extensive decline in tropical forest cover due to a large expansion of agriculture. Under all four RCPs, fire potential could increase across extensive land areas, particularly tropical and sub-tropical latitudes. River outflows are simulated to increase with higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and global warming in all projections, with outflow increasing with mean temperature at the end of the 21st Century at the global scale and in North America, Asia, and Africa. In South America, Europe, and Australia, the relationship with climate warming and CO<sub>2</sub> rise is less clear, probably as a result of land cover change exerting a dominant effect in those regions.",

An evaluation indicates that, unless there is a decline of about one-fourth in total crop yields, the U.S. land resource base will be adequate and food security can be met. The impacts of climate change on individual crop production regions are hard to predict, however, and may be either negative or positive. The assumption must be made that agriculture faces an uncertain future and, therefore, must rely upon experience, adoption of proven technologies, development of new technologies, and improved husbandry of land, water, and energy resources. Carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases, can be emitted, as well as sequestered, in large amounts by agriculture. Agriculture has a great opportunity to help mitigate climate change by stashing CO2\\_as C in soil and vegetation and by displacing fossil fuels. Practices requiring good agricultural husbandry, which should be implemented anyway, can be quite effective for sequestering C. For cropland, these practices include building soil organic matter levels, improving soil fertility, and growing more food on less land. Carbon pools are maintained, restored, and enlarged on croplands by increased use of conservation tillage, improved use of animal and other wastes, minimized dryland fallowing, and preservation of marginal lands. On forestlands, reforestation, forestation (including tree planting on conservation reserve program land), and improved forest harvesting practices maintain and enlarge C-pools. Preservation of wetlands does much to maintain C-pools. Collectively, these practices can potentially offset not only the CO2\\_emissions from U.S. agriculture, but also part of that from U.S. sources outside of agriculture",

Here we report a systematic attempt to determine the range of climate changes consistent with these uncertainties, based on a 53-member ensemble of model versions constructed by varying model parameters. We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5\u201395 per cent probability range of 2.4\u20135.4Â Â°C. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation5, 6.",

While the former process is well established in state-of-the-art climate model simulations, less attention has been paid to the latter. However, the low latitudes appear to be particularly sensitive to land use changes, especially in tropical Africa where frequent drought episodes were observed during recent decades. Here several ensembles of long-term transient climate change experiments are presented with a regional climate model to estimate the future pathway of African climate under fairly realistic forcing conditions. Therefore, the simulations are forced with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations as well as land use changes until 2050. Three different scenarios are prescribed in order to assess the range of options inferred from global political, social, and economical development. The authors find a prominent surface heating and a weakening of the hydrological cycle over most of tropical Africa, resulting in enhanced heat stress and extended dry spells. In contrast, the large-scale atmospheric circulation in upper levels is less affected, pointing to a primarily local effect of land degradation on near-surface climate. In the model study, it turns out that land use changes are primarily responsible for the simulated climate response. In general, simulated climate changes are not concealed by internal variability. Thus, the effect of land use changes has to be accounted for when developing more realistic scenarios for future African climate.",

         "volume": "156","pages": "119981","abstract": "Climate change is real and its impacts are mostly negative, but common portrayals of devastation are unfounded. Scenarios set out under the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) show human welfare will likely increase to 450\\% of today's welfare over the 21st century. Climate damages will reduce this welfare increase to 434\\%. Arguments for devastation typically claim that extreme weather (like droughts, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes) is already worsening because of climate change. This is mostly misleading and inconsistent with the IPCC literature. For instance, the IPCC finds no trend for global hurricane frequency and has low confidence in attribution of changes to human activity, while the US has not seen an increase in landfalling hurricanes since 1900. Global death risk from extreme weather has declined 99\\% over 100 years and global costs have declined 26\\% over the last 28 years. Arguments for devastation typically ignore adaptation, which will reduce vulnerability dramatically. While climate research suggests that fewer but stronger future hurricanes will increase damages, this effect will be countered by richer and more resilient societies. Global cost of hurricanes will likely decline from 0.04\\% of GDP today to 0.02\\% in 2100. Climate-economic research shows that the total cost from untreated climate change is negative but moderate, likely equivalent to a 3.6\\% reduction in total GDP. Climate policies also have costs that often vastly outweigh their climate benefits. The Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, will cost \\$819\u2013\\$1,890 billion per year in 2030, yet will reduce emissions by just 1\\% of what is needed to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5Â°C. Each dollar spent on Paris will likely produce climate benefits worth 11Â¢. Long-term impacts of climate policy can cost even more. The IPCC's two best future scenarios are the \u201Csustainable\u201D SSP1 and the \u201Cfossil-fuel driven\u201D SSP5. Current climate-focused attitudes suggest we aim for the \u201Csustainable\u201D world, but the higher economic growth in SSP5 actually leads to much greater welfare for humanity. After adjusting for climate damages, SSP5 will on average leave grandchildren of today's poor \\$48,000 better off every year. It will reduce poverty by 26 million each year until 2050, inequality will be lower, and more than 80 million premature deaths will be avoided. Using carbon taxes, an optimal realistic climate policy can aggressively reduce emissions and reduce the global temperature increase from 4.1Â°C in 2100 to 3.75Â°C. This will cost \\$18 trillion, but deliver climate benefits worth twice that. The popular 2Â°C target, in contrast, is unrealistic and would leave the world more than \\$250 trillion worse off. The most effective climate policy is increasing investment in green R&D to make future decarbonization much cheaper. This can deliver \\$11 of climate benefits for each dollar spent. More effective climate policies can help the world do better. The current climate discourse leads to wasteful climate policies, diverting attention and funds from more effective ways to improve the world.",

To better understand changes in extreme precipitation, they may be decomposed into contributions from atmospheric thermodynamics and dynamics5, 6, 7, but these are typically diagnosed with spatially aggregated data8, 9 or using a statistical approach that is not valid at all locations10, 11. Here we decompose the forced response of daily regional scale extreme precipitation in climate-model simulations into thermodynamic and dynamic contributions using a robust physical diagnostic8. We show that thermodynamics alone would lead to a spatially homogeneous fractional increase, which is consistent across models and dominates the sign of the change in most regions. However, the dynamic contribution modifies regional responses, amplifying increases, for instance, in the Asian monsoon region, but weakening them across the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. Over subtropical oceans, the dynamic contribution is strong enough to cause robust regional decreases in extreme precipitation, which may partly result from a poleward circulation shift. The dynamic contribution is key to reducing uncertainties in future projections of regional extreme precipitation.",

Understanding how the occurrence of drought may change in the future and which sources of uncertainty are dominant can inform appropriate decisions to guide drought impacts assessments. Uncertainties in future projections of drought arise from several sources and our aim is to understand how these sources of uncertainty contribute to future projections of drought. We consider four sources of uncertainty; climate model uncertainty associated with future climate projections, future emissions of greenhouse gases (future scenario uncertainty), type of drought (drought index uncertainty) and drought event definition (threshold uncertainty). Three drought indices (the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)) are calculated for the A1B and RCP2.6 future emissions scenarios using monthly model output from a 57 member perturbed parameter ensemble of climate simulations of the HadCM3C Earth system model, for the baseline period, 1961\u20131990, and the period 2070\u20132099 (representing the 2080s). We consider where there are significant increases or decreases in the proportion of time spent in drought in the 2080s compared to the baseline and compare the effects from the four sources of uncertainty. Our results suggest that, of the included uncertainty sources, choice of drought index is the most important factor influencing uncertainty in future projections of drought (60\\%\u201385\\% of total included uncertainty). There is a greater range of uncertainty between drought indices than that between the mitigation scenario RCP2.6 and the A1B emissions scenario (5\\%\u20136\\% in the 2050s to 17\\%\u201318\\% in the 2080s) and across the different model variants in the ensemble (9\\%\u201317\\%). Choice of drought threshold has the least influence on uncertainty in future drought projections (0.4\\%\u20137\\%). Despite the large range of uncertainty in drought projections for many regions, projections for some regions have a clear signal, with uncertainty associated with the magnitude of change rather than direction. For instance, a significant increase in time spent in drought is consistently projected for the Amazon, Central America and South Africa whilst projections for Northern India consistently show significant decreases in time spent in drought. We conclude that choice of which drought index (or drought indices) to use when undertaking drought impacts assessments is of considerable importance relative to choices relating to the other three included sources of uncertainty in this study. This information will help ensure that future drought impacts assessments are designed appropriately to account for uncertainty.",

         "abstract": "Climate change exposes people to conditions that are historically unusual but that will become increasingly common over time. What kind of weather do people think of as normal or unusual under these changing conditions? We use the volume of social media posts about weather to measure the remarkability of different temperatures and show that remarkability changes rapidly with repeated exposure to unusual temperatures. The reference point for normal conditions appears to be based on weather experienced between 2 and 8 y ago. This rapidly shifting normal baseline means warming noticed by the general public may not be clearly distinguishable from zero over the 21st century, with potential implications for both the acceptance of global warming and public pressure for mitigation policies.The changing global climate is producing increasingly unusual weather relative to preindustrial conditions. In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years\u2014rather than longer historical periods\u2014determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a \u201Cboiling frog\u201D effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.",

The projected yields of crops under a range of agricultural and climatic scenarios are needed to assess food security prospects. Previous meta-analyses3 have summarized climate change impacts and adaptive potential as a function of temperature, but have not examined uncertainty, the timing of impacts, or the quantitative effectiveness of adaptation. Here we develop a new data set of more than 1,700 published simulations to evaluate yield impacts of climate change and adaptation. Without adaptation, losses in aggregate production are expected for wheat, rice and maize in both temperate and tropical regions by 2 Â°C of local warming. Crop-level adaptations increase simulated yields by an average of 7\u201315\\%, with adaptations more effective for wheat and rice than maize. Yield losses are greater in magnitude for the second half of the century than for the first. Consensus on yield decreases in the second half of the century is stronger in tropical than temperate regions, yet even moderate warming may reduce temperate crop yields in many locations. Although less is known about interannual variability than mean yields, the available data indicate that increases in yield variability are likely.",

Combining daily weather data and crop phenology models, we find that cultivated area in the US suited to dryland winter wheat?soybeans, the most common double crop (DC) system, increased by up to 28\\% from 1988 to 2012. Changes in the observed distribution of DC area over the same period agree well with this suitability increase, evidence consistent with climate change playing a role in recent DC expansion in phenologically constrained states. We then apply the model to projections of future climate under the RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios and estimate an additional 126?239\\% increase, respectively, in DC area. Sensitivity tests reveal that in most instances, increases in mean temperature are more important than delays in fall freeze in driving increased DC suitability. The results suggest that climate change will relieve phenological constraints on wheat?soy DC systems over much of the United States, though it should be recognized that impacts on corn and soybean yields in this region are expected to be negative and larger in magnitude than the 0.4?0.75\\% per decade benefits we estimate here for double cropping.",

The simulations with a horizontal resolution of 60 km for Europe and 20 km for central Europe were driven by meteorological boundary conditions provided by a long-term simulation of the global climate model ECHAM4. Two time slices of about 10 years were compared, one representing the 1990s and one representing the 2030s. For the region of southern Germany the simulations show an increase of the mean summer temperature by almost 2 degrees along with a decrease of cloud water and ice and a corresponding increase of the photolysis frequencies and the emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons. Under the model assumption of unchanged anthropogenic emissions this leads to an increase of the mean mixing ratios of most photooxidants. Because of the complex topography and the heterogeneous distribution of precursor emissions all parameters show pronounced regional patterns. The average daily maximum ozone concentrations in southern Germany increase for the considered scenario by nearly 10\\% in the summer months. Depending on the region, the increase of the mean daily maximum ranges between 2 and 6 ppb. As a consequence, the number of days when the 8-hour mean of the ozone concentration exceeds the threshold value of 120 mu g m(-3) increases by 5 to 12 days per year.",

Through diagnoses of ensembles of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments, we demonstrate that this climate change is a response to the temporal history of sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Specifically, 58 of 67 multi-model ensemble members (87\\%), forced with observed global SSTs since 1950, simulate a positive trend in a winter index of the NAO, and the spatial pattern of the multi-model ensemble mean trend agrees with that observed. An ensemble of AGCM simulations with only tropical SST forcing further suggests that variations in these SSTs are of primary importance. The probability distribution function (PDF) of 50-year NAO index trends from the forced simulations are, moreover, appreciably different from the PDF of a control simulation with no interannual SST variability, although chaotic atmospheric variations are shown to yield substantial 50-year trends. Our results thus advance the view that the observed linear trend in the winter NAO index is a combination of a strong tropically forced signal and an appreciable  \u201D noise\u201D component of the same phase. The changes in tropical rainfall of greatest relevance include increased rainfall over the equatorial Indian Ocean, a change that has likely occurred in nature and is physically consistent with the observed, significant warming trend of the underlying sea surface.",

High-resolution palaeo-temperature reconstructions and the complete record of warfare incidence in eastern China were compared. Results show that warfare frequency in eastern China (its southern portion in particular) significantly correlated with the Northern Hemisphere temperature oscillations. Almost all peaks of warfare frequency and dynastic changes occurred in cooling phases. We suggest that in historic China, the reduction of thermal energy during cooling phases significantly shrank agricultural production. Such ecological stress interacted with population pressure and China's unique historic and geographic setting to bring about the high frequencies of warfare over the last millennium. We recommend scholars take climate change into account as they consider the anthropology of warfare in the historic past.",

ENFA generated distribution models that varied in accuracy from high to very high (area under the curve AUC = 0.87-0.97), with the lowest AUC obtained for B. annulatus. PCA provided an adequate separation of the climate niches of different species in the reduced space of the variables. Climate scenarios and factorial consensus analysis were used to evaluate the geographic impact of climate change (as turnover in habitat suitability) on the niches of the ticks and net variations in habitat availability. The scenario that was most compatible with estimates of future climate in the Mediterranean region (increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall) was predicted to produce a sharp increase in the extent of suitable habitat for R. bursa, R. turanicus, and H. marginatum. This scenario would result in a northward expansion of suitable habitat areas for these three species. The highest impact (highest species turnover) would be recorded at the margin of the current distribution range of the three species. A sensitivity analysis of the ecological response of the ticks to the climate change scenarios showed that the response is statistically different in different regions of the PCA-derived niche. These results outline the need to further investigate the potential of bioclimate models to obtain accurate estimations of tick species turnover under conditions of climate change over wide areas.",

For the study domain that extends from 51&\\#176; to 71&\\#176; N and 3&\\#176; to 33&\\#176; E, in the near-term (i.e. the middle of the current century) natural variability exceed the climate change signal. By the end of the twenty-first century there is evidence for small magnitude declines in most metrics of the wind climate relative to the 1961-1990 control period and for possible increases in extreme wind speeds, but the regionally averaged changes are of small magnitude relative to variations in two simulations of the control period. The analyses thus indicate that unlike precipitation and thermal regimes, the influence of the SRES on projections of the wind climate is small compared to natural variability and other sources of uncertainty in the downscaled projections. Results presented herein indicate that the AOGCM used to downscale wind climates has greater influence on the downscaled projections than stochastic effects within individual AOCGM simulations or the emission scenario applied.\n\n\n\tGerman\n\tDie hier gezeigten Analysen dienen der Untersuchung, ob herunterskalierte Projektionen vom globalen ECHAM5/MPI-OM1 Atmosph&\\#228;re-Ozean Klimamodel (AOGCM) eine erh&\\#246;hte Empfindlichkeit gegen&\\#252;ber Ver&\\#228;nderungen im Emissionsszenario (SRES) aufweisen, und ob Projektionen m&\\#246;glicher nordeurop&\\#228;ischer Windklimate au&\\#223;erhalb der Spannweite des bisher beobachteten Klimas liegen.

Such a decision-analytic focus uses the products of climate science as probabilistic predictions about the effects of management policies3. Here we present methods to detect when climate predictions are failing to capture the system dynamics. For a single model, we measure goodness of fit based on the empirical distribution function, and define failure when the distribution of observed values significantly diverges from the modelled distribution. For a set of models, the same statistic can be used to provide relative weights for the individual models, and we define failure when there is no linear weighting of the ensemble models that produces a satisfactory match to the observations. Early detection of failure of a set of predictions is important for improving model predictions and the decisions based on them. We show that these methods would have detected a range shift in northern pintail 20 years before it was actually discovered, and are increasingly giving more weight to those climate models that forecast a September ice-free Arctic by 2055.",

Internally, claiming geopolitical identity was also a state-making device. Amateur experiments and climate policy critique became forms of democratic action. Experiences of environmental vulnerability are rooted in their political contexts. Critical attention has recently turned to the climate change  \u201D synecdoche\u201D: a place uniquely exposed to the environmental consequences of climate crisis, such as sea-level rise, that becomes a stand-in for the global crisis as a whole and a harbinger of more widespread disaster. The Maldives, which scientists, politicians, and activists predict could be completely submerged by 2100, filled that role between the 2008 inauguration of Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected president after years of authoritarian rule, and his 2012 ouster. This ethnography of the Maldivian challenge to climate change asks how claiming a geopolitical identity as the world's  \u201D canary in the coalmine\u201D fostered an emerging internal political culture. I argue that arming climate change solutions became a state-making device in the Maldives, whose fragile coral atoll ecosystem itself became the synecdoche of a young democracy. Between 2008 and 2012, how was environmental knowledge creation understood as a democratic activity? To answer this question, I draw on ethnographic interview testimony and participant-observation in MalÃ©, the Maldivian capital, with politicians, activists, and city residents, as well as an analysis of the Nasheed administration's public rhetoric. The article centers on the case of Bluepeace, the country's oldest environmental NGO, which has seen significant international publicity. Following Bluepeace's efforts to help the Maldives achieve carbon neutrality by 2020\u2014part of Nasheed's plan to end global climate change through exemplary national sacrifice\u2014this article finds that climate problem solving and democracy were put to work for one another through small-scale mitigation and adaptation experiments.",

In post-hunter-gatherer societies, extra-somatic energy has greatly expanded and intensified the catching, gathering, and production of food. Modern relations between energy, food, and health are very complex, raising serious, high-level policy challenges. Together with persistent widespread under-nutrition, over-nutrition (and sedentarism) is causing obesity and associated serious health consequences. Worldwide, agricultural activity, especially livestock production, accounts for about a fifth of total greenhouse-gas emissions, thus contributing to climate change and its adverse health consequences, including the threat to food yields in many regions. Particular policy attention should be paid to the health risks posed by the rapid worldwide growth in meat consumption, both by exacerbating climate change and by directly contributing to certain diseases. To prevent increased greenhouse-gas emissions from this production sector, both the average worldwide consumption level of animal products and the intensity of emissions from livestock production must be reduced. An international contraction and convergence strategy offers a feasible route to such a goal. The current global average meat consumption is 100 g per person per day, with about a ten-fold variation between high-consuming and low-consuming populations. 90 g per day is proposed as a working global target, shared more evenly, with not more than 50 g per day coming from red meat from ruminants (ie, cattle, sheep, goats, and other digastric grazers).",

This paper (1) evaluated four process-based crop models; (2) assessed the effects of climate change on maize yield using climate change outputs from seven global climate models (GCMs) under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs); and (3) disaggregated the contributions of multiple crop models, GCMs and RCPs to overall uncertainty. All four models captured more than 80\\% of the variation in days to silking, maturity and yield, indicating reasonably reproduced observations. Similarly, the root mean square errors were moderate for days to silking and maturity (fewer than 4 days) and yield (0.5\u20130.7 t/ha). Overall, the results indicate that the models could assess grain yield at the study sites reasonably well. The results of the multiple models ensemble indicate that the maize yield will decrease by 9\u201311\\% with a probability of 72\u201380\\% on average during the period 2010\u20132039 relative to the baseline (1976\u20132005). The uncertainty in the maize-yield simulations might arise mostly from the GCM models, followed by the crop models and RCPs, the contribution of which could be neglected relative to the other factors. Therefore, the use of a multiple crop model and a GCM ensemble is advisable in order to account properly for uncertainties in crop assessments.",

The debate on interdisciplinarity and bibliometric measures is reviewed to operationalize the contested notion of interdisciplinarity. The results, based on 6417 references of the 96 most frequently used journals, demonstrate that the IPCC assessment of climate change is best characterized by its multidisciplinarity where the physical, biological, bodily and societal dimensions are clearly separated. Although a few fields and journals integrate a wide variety of disciplines, integration occurs mainly between related disciplines (narrow interdisciplinarity) which indicate an overall disciplinary basis of climate research. It is concluded that interdisciplinarity is not a prominent feature of climate research. The significance of this finding is explored, given that the problem scope of climate change necessitates interdisciplinarity. Ways to promote interdisciplinarity are suggested by way of conclusion.",

One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective.",

Proponents of the most common approach (probabilistic event attribution) argue for using single event attribution for advancing climate policy, not least in the context of loss and damages, while critics are raising concerns about inductive risks which may result in misguided policies. Here, we present six ethical predicaments, rooted in epistemic choices of single event attribution for policy making, with a focus on problems related to loss and damage. Our results show that probabilistic event attribution is particularly sensitive to these predicaments, rendering the choice of method value laden and hence political. Our review shows how the putatively apolitical approach becomes political and deeply problematic from a climate justice perspective. We also suggest that extreme event attribution (EEA) is becoming more and more irrelevant for projecting loss and damages as socio-ecological systems are increasingly destabilized by climate change. We conclude by suggesting a more causality driven approach for understanding loss and damage, that is, less prone to the ethical predicaments of EEA.",

         "volume": "228","pages": "105890","abstract": "Warming and increasing extreme climate events are expected to reduce crop yields including rice production in China, threatening the Chinese food security. Shifting sowing date has been considered as a key adaptation strategy to sustain rice production in China. However, the extent to which it can mitigate the adverse climate change impact on yield and whether more irrigation is required remains unclear. Here, by driving ORYZA v3 with four climate models (GCMs), we analyzed the impacts of climate change on China rice yield and net irrigation water requirement (NIR) at 21 sites under a wide range of sowing date. We found that without altering sowing date, weighted average rice yield for all sites will decline 5.1, 7.3 and 15.1% in periods 2011\u20132040, 2041\u20132070 and 2071\u20132100, respectively. Yields losses in temperate zones are linked to increased crop development rates with higher temperatures, but in subtropical regions, the reduction is more related to the damage of heat stress during rice heading or flowering periods. NIR increases notably in all regions (up to 71%) except northeastern China, where the shortened growth duration resulted in less time to consume water. When the optimized sowing date is applied, average yield losses will be effectively compensated. To achieve these, rice-sowing date will be shifted by up to 54 days and on average 17.8\u201323.4 % more fresh water in future periods are needed to meet the water requirement of rice growth. We also found that, due to increasing the frequency of heat events, farmers in Chinese rice production regions (e.g., Yangtze River Basin) will have narrow sowing windows at the end of this century. This study suggests that adequate irrigation and adjusting sowing dates could mitigate the negative climate impacts on rice production in China.",

Climate change adaptation and ozone regulation have been identified as important strategies to safeguard food production5, 6, but little is known about how climate and ozone pollution interact to affect agriculture, nor the relative effectiveness of these two strategies for different crops and regions. Here we present an integrated analysis of the individual and combined effects of 2000\u20132050 climate change and ozone trends on the production of four major crops (wheat, rice, maize and soybean) worldwide based on historical observations and model projections, specifically accounting for ozone\u2013temperature co-variation. The projections exclude the effect of rising CO2, which has complex and potentially offsetting impacts on global food supply7, 8, 9, 10. We show that warming reduces global crop production by >10\\% by 2050 with a potential to substantially worsen global malnutrition in all scenarios considered. Ozone trends either exacerbate or offset a substantial fraction of climate impacts depending on the scenario, suggesting the importance of air quality management in agricultural planning. Furthermore, we find that depending on region some crops are primarily sensitive to either ozone (for example, wheat) or heat (for example, maize) alone, providing a measure of relative benefits of climate adaptation versus ozone regulation for food security in different regions.",

This paper presents an example of a modeling tool for projections of possible changes in the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), and the subsequent changes in vaccination needs, during the next half-century in Sweden. The model is based on the Hadley Center's regional temperature predictions for the year 2050, taking into account the IPCC IS92 `non-intervention scenario'. The model has been constructed into STELLA, a graphical dynamic-simulation, soft-ware program. The model project an increase in TBE incidence in Stockholm County, a high-endemic region in Sweden, during the next 50 years. According to this simplified model, the annual vaccination rate need to increase by 3-4-fold during the next half century in order to prevent the projected increases in TBE incidence in the region from a climatic change.",

A typical framing is that researchers are exploring a \u2018Plan B\u2019 in case mitigation fails to avert dangerous climate change. Some options are thought to have the potential to alter the politics of climate change dramatically, yet in evaluating whether they might ultimately reduce climate risks, their political and security implications have so far not been given adequate prominence. This article puts forward what it calls the \u2018security hazard\u2019 and argues that this could be a crucial factor in determining whether a technology is able, ultimately, to reduce climate risks. Ideas about global governance of geoengineering rely on heroic assumptions about state rationality and a generally pacific international system. Moreover, if in a climate engineered world weather events become something certain states can be made directly responsible for, this may also negatively affect prospects for \u2018Plan A\u2019, i.e. an effective global agreement on mitigation.",

Examining the case law concerning the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, this article demonstrates that climate change proceedings in the European Union raise questions that stand at the heart of the EU legal order; that is, they demand that the boundaries of the EU's regulatory competences are drawn. In effect, the EU courts focus on ensuring that EU climate change laws are in accord with the rule of law or, in the context of EU law, the borders of the EU's environmental regulatory powers. As such, this article shows that attention needs to be given to the interaction between climate change laws and the constitutional role of the EU judiciary. These interactions are considered here together with the contingency of EU climate change litigation on EU legal culture.",

The study evaluates changes in the intensity of extreme significant wave height (SWH) throughout the year over the 1980\u20132008 period, using a calibrated long-term wave reanalysis database forced with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. A non-stationary extreme value model, based on monthly maxima with a new approach for long-term trends, has been applied. Results show a common positive trend in the Pacific basin throughout all seasons and a significant decreasing trend pattern in the area of Surinam and north of Brazil, on the Atlantic border (up to â1.5Â cm/year in March\u2013April\u2013May). A higher increase of the extreme wave heights is found in the austral summer (December\u2013January\u2013February) at Tierra de Fuego and the Falkland Islands, reaching 6.5Â cm/year (which means 1.82Â m for the 28Â years studied). Furthermore, the complete reanalysis period (1948\u20132008) is analyzed in order to compare results with the assimilation data period (1980\u20132008), resulting in some discrepancies, especially in the Atlantic basin.",

The main research tool was an integrated modeling framework and the main product was a consistent set of long-term scenarios covering Europe between 1995 and 2100. Scenarios consisted of trends in emissions, acid deposition, nitrogen deposition and climate change. Critical loads and critical levels were used to assess the impacts of deposition to forest soils and a new analogous concept of #critical##climate##change# was developed to assess the impacts of climate change. Taking into consideration the limitations of the scope and models used in the study, preliminary conclusions were: (1) regional air pollution and climate change may be fairly weakly coupled in the natural environment, i.e. climate change was not found to have a large impact on the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to regional air pollution, nor on the distribution of deposition; nor did regional air pollution (in the form of sulfate aerosols) have a significant impact on climate change in Europe; (2) however, regional air pollution and climate change may be strongly coupled in the #policy# environment. It was estimated that virtually all of Europe at mid-century might be affected by either regional air pollution or climate change, or both, and this will require a strong policy response. Moreover, the indirect effects of climate policies were found to reduce the costs of controlling air pollution emissions by more than 50%, suggesting a strong potential financial linkage between policies to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions.",

This article unpacks the different components of the debate to determine the source of the political divide that is so noted in the mainstream media and academic literatures. Through analysis of the content of congressional hearings on the issue of climate change, we are able to explain political polarization of the issue more fully. In particular, our results show that, contrary to representations in the mainstream media, there is increasing consensus over the science of the issue. Discussions of the type of policy instrument and the economic implications of regulating carbon dioxide emissions, however, continue to polarize opinion. This article concludes by exploring how these findings help us understand more recent political events around climate change.",

As the characteristics of wildfires change, it is critical to understand where emerging risks for human and natural systems are most profound. We assess how future wildfire potential, defined here as the meteorological conditions and the availability of burnable vegetation types conducive to wildfire occurrence, are projected to change in the future. To achieve this, we combine modelled temperature and precipitation to calculate the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) as a proxy for soil moisture deficit and overlay a weighting factor representing burnable vegetation derived from land cover classifications. Through our analysis of daily data at both mid- and end-of-century, we find that climate-related changes, such as increasing temperatures and drying patterns, will elevate wildfire potential globally, both in terms of severity of maximum daily KBDI and frequency of high KBDI days. We find that regions which have recently endured major fire events, including the western United States, Australia, and the Amazon, could experience increases in maximum KBDI of up to 100 in places, with more than 60 additional days of high KBDI by mid-century, compared to the historical baseline. Additionally, at the end-of-the-century, regions across much of Africa, Central America, and Southern Asia are projected to emerge as wildfire hotspots. While the occurrence of wildfires may still be rare today in many regions, we find that climatological trends are projected to increase wildfire potential for much of the globe, creating new risks for some, and raising the challenge for already wildfire-prone communities to effectively manage forests and protect people and critical resources.",

Impact assessments can be, in many cases, laborious processes leading to inevitable methodological compromises that drastically affect the robustness of the conclusions. In this study we examine the implications of different CMIP5-based regional and global climate model ensembles for projections of the hydrological impacts of climate change. We compare results from three different assessments of hydrological impacts under high-end climate change (RCP8.5) across Europe, and we focus on how methodological differences affect the projections. We assess, as systematically as possible, the differences in runoff projections as simulated by a land surface model driven by three different sets of climate projections over the European continent at global warming of 1.5 &deg;C, 2 &deg;C and 4 &deg;C relative to pre-industrial levels, according to the RCP8.5 concentration scenario. We find that these methodological differences lead to considerably different outputs for a number of indicators used to express different aspects of runoff. We further use a number of new global climate model experiments, with an emphasis on high resolution, to test the assumption that many of the uncertainties in regional climate and hydrological changes are driven predominantly by the prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice concentrations (SICs) and we find that results are more sensitive to the choice of the atmosphere model compared to the driving SSTs. Finally, we combine all sources of information to identify robust patterns of hydrological changes across the European continent.",

The latest version of the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model, HadGEM1, includes the TRIP (total runoff including pathways) global river routing scheme. We have analysed the predicted changes in global river flow under the IPCC SRES A1B and A2 scenarios from HadGEM1-TRIP simulations. Global total river flow was predicted to increase by 4\u20138\\% during the 2071\u20132100 period relative to 1961\u20131990, although there were large regional differences\u2014for example, large increases in river flow in boreal regions and western Africa, and large decreases in river flow in southern Europe and North Africa. Significant changes in the seasonality of river flow could also occur, such as earlier peaks in spring runoff in boreal rivers due to earlier snow melt. In our simulations, large increases in monthly maximum flow and decreases in monthly minimum flow were found, although the increases in monthly maximum flow were generally larger. Thus, climate change is likely to increase the occurrence of both high and low flows, although the increased high flows could be dominant. \\copyright Crown Copyright 2006.

Deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) results in a net reduction in atmospheric carbon. BECCS may be one of the few cost-effective carbon-negative opportunities available should anthropogenic climate change be worse than anticipated or emissions reductions in other sectors prove particularly difficult4, 5. Previous work, primarily using integrated assessment models, has identified the critical role of BECCS in long-term (pre- or post-2100 time frames) climate change mitigation, but has not investigated the role of BECCS in power systems in detail, or in aggressive time frames6, 7, even though commercial-scale facilities are starting to be deployed in the transportation sector8. Here, we explore the economic and deployment implications for BECCS in the electricity system of western North America under aggressive (pre-2050) time frames and carbon emissions limitations, with rich technology representation and physical constraints. We show that BECCS, combined with aggressive renewable deployment and fossil-fuel emission reductions, can enable a carbon-negative power system in western North America by 2050 with up to 145\\% emissions reduction from 1990 levels. In most scenarios, the offsets produced by BECCS are found to be more valuable to the power system than the electricity it provides. Advanced biomass power generation employs similar system design to advanced coal technology, enabling a transition strategy to low-carbon energy.",

We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i.e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.",

In many cases, natural systems are converted into agricultural land to feed the growing population. However, despite climate change being a major focus nowadays, the impacts of these conversions on water resources, which are essential for agricultural production, is still often neglected, jeopardizing the sustainability of the socio-ecological system. This study investigates historic land use/land cover (LULC) patterns as well as potential future LULCC and its effect on water quantities in a complex tropical catchment in Tanzania. It then compares the results using two climate change scenarios. The Land Change Modeler (LCM) is used to analyze and to project LULC patterns until 2030 and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is utilized to simulate the water balance under various LULC conditions. Results show decreasing low flows by 6&ndash;8\\% for the LULC scenarios, whereas high flows increase by up to 84\\% for the combined LULC and climate change scenarios. The effect of climate change is stronger compared to the effect of LULCC, but also contains higher uncertainties. The effects of LULCC are more distinct, although crop specific effects show diverging effects on water balance components. This study develops a methodology for quantifying the impact of land use and climate change and therefore contributes to the sustainable management of the investigated catchment, as it shows the impact of environmental change on hydrological extremes (low flow and floods) and determines hot spots, which are critical for environmental development.",

We focus the analysis on a comparison between the driving and nested model runs. For present climate, the two models show temperature and precipitation biases of similar magnitude but different spatial patterns. In particular the bias patterns in the regional model driven by ECHAM5 are more similar to those of a regional simulation driven by ERA Interim reanalysis fields than to the bias patterns in the present climate simulation by ECHAM5 itself. In the transient simulation, while the temperature changes are strongly driven by the global model, the precipitation change patterns are more different between the global and regional models, particularly over the West Africa and Sahel regions. A targeted analysis suggests that this is due to the different simulation by the two models of the local response to El NiÃ±o\u2013Southern Oscillation forcing and of local soil moisture/precipitation feedbacks. Our results thus indicate that local processes and internal model physics and characteristics are important elements in determining the precipitation change signal simulated by the nested regional model in this large domain experiment, especially over equatorial and tropical regions. This adds an element of uncertainty that needs to be address through the use of ensembles of regional model experiments as planned in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project.",

SDD uses an extended circulation weather type (CWT) analysis on global daily mean sea level pressure fields with the central point being located over Germany. Seventy-seven weather classes based on the associated CWT and the intensity of the geostrophic flow are identified. Representatives of these classes are dynamically downscaled with the regional climate model COSMO-CLM. By using weather class frequencies of different data sets, the simulated representatives are recombined to probability density functions (PDFs) of near-surface wind speed and finally to Eout of a sample wind turbine for present and future climate. This is performed for reanalysis, decadal hindcasts and long-term future projections. For evaluation purposes, results of SDD are compared to wind observations and to simulated Eout of purely dynamical downscaling (DD) methods. For the present climate, SDD is able to simulate realistic PDFs of 10-m wind speed for most stations in Germany. The resulting spatial Eout patterns are similar to DD-simulated Eout. In terms of decadal hindcasts, results of SDD are similar to DD-simulated Eout over Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, and Benelux, for which high correlations between annual Eout time series of SDD and DD are detected for selected hindcasts. Lower correlation is found for other European countries. It is demonstrated that SDD can be used to downscale the full ensemble of the Earth System Model of the Max Planck Institute (MPI-ESM) decadal prediction system. Long-term climate change projections in Special Report on Emission Scenarios of ECHAM5/MPI-OM as obtained by SDD agree well to the results of other studies using DD methods, with increasing Eout over northern Europe and a negative trend over southern Europe. Despite some biases, it is concluded that SDD is an adequate tool to assess regional wind energy changes in large model ensembles.",

         "abstract": "Many uncertainties remain about the achievability of UK emissions reduction targets. This paper assesses uncertainties that could have the greatest impact on compliance with the 4th carbon budget (2023\u20132027). The paper also suggests strategies that could help to manage or mitigate these uncertainties. The UK is committed to ambitious medium- and long-term climate change targets, including a commitment to an 80\\% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. Whilst emissions have fallen significantly since 1990, further reductions will be increasingly difficult to achieve. The government has agreed carbon budgets to the late 2020s that are consistent with the long-term 80\\% target. However, increasing energy prices since the mid-2000s and the 2008 financial crisis have led to cracks in the political consensus in support of these budgets and targets. This paper carries out an assessment of the feasibility of the UK's agreed low carbon pathway over the medium term, with a particular focus on the fourth carbon budget (2023\u201327). It analyses the uncertainties associated with the specific changes that may be necessary to comply with this carbon budget \u2013 including measures to decarbonise electricity, heat and transport. This analysis focuses on 'instrumental' uncertainties associated with specific areas of the energy system (e.g. the decarbonisation of heat in households) and 'systemic' uncertainties that tend to have more pervasive implications for the energy system as a whole (e.g. uncertainties associated with public attitudes). A framework is developed that sets out and analyses the key uncertainties under those two broad categories, in terms of their complexity and their potential impact on the fourth carbon budget. Through the application of this framework the paper also considers strategies to mitigate or manage these uncertainties, and which actors could help develop and implement these strategies.",

It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (<180 kg/cow), the 'hottest' 25Ã25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17\\% of the potential milk production of today's average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach \\pounds13.4M in average years and \\pounds33.8M in extreme years.",

These communities face the risk of exposure due to water level rise, change in weather conditions and extreme weather events. The main means of livelihood in these communities is fishing which has been greatly impacted by climate change coupled with pollution that is endemic in Niger Delta. The perceived changes in weather conditions observed by the fishers in the two communities include changes in water depth, frequency and intensity of temperature and fluctuation in timing of rainfall. These perceived changes have contributed to increase in fishing efforts, fishing time, decrease in fish catch amongst others which in turn have affected their fishing livelihood. Thus there is a need to build up the resilience which starts from knowing their present coping strategies and proffering better coping strategies that will enhance resilience for the fishers.",

The increase in temperature is believed to be the main cause. The earlier start of flowering will have consequences for the start of the pollen season, and thus for the start of the hay fever season. Millions of people world-wide will therefore experience the impact of climate change in their daily lives during spring and summer. In this paper we analyse the relation between climate parameters, especially temperature, and the start of the pollen season in the western part of the Netherlands based on daily pollen counts of the Leiden University Medical Centre and temperature measurements from 1969 till 2000 by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between temperature and start of the pollen season. An advance of the start of the pollen season of 3 to 22 days has been observed. The potential future changes in the start of the pollen season under climate change scenarios are also discussed. Copyright \\copyright 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.",

The evidence presented describes how global warming will impact where and how food is produced and discusses the significant consequences for food security, health and nutrition, water scarcity and climate adaptation. The book also highlights the implications for global food trade.\n\nThe evidence presented in the book is presented in a way that is widely accessible to policy decision makers and practitioners and makes a distinct contribution towards a greater science-policy interchange. Put together, the different analyses in the book paint a comprehensive perspective linking climate change to food, nutrition, water, and trade along with suggested policy responses.",

         "abstract": "The northern Indian Ocean consists by two seas namely the Bay of Bengal in the east side and the Arabian Sea located to the west side. The tropical cyclone activity in the Bay of Bengal is generally higher than that of the Arabian Sea. But new research has been conducted recently showed a drastic shift in this trend of cyclone incidences. In Indian Ocean five Cyclones forms annually in the Bay of Bengal and only one Cyclone develops in the Arabian Sea. But now a days risk scenario is drastically changing, about two years back in May 2020 cyclone Amphan gathered energy from anomalously high sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, intensified and turned into a catastrophic cyclone within a one day. After a span of one week, Nisarga cyclone was formed over the Arabian Sea and struck into western coast of India. The western part of the tropical Indian Ocean has been warming for about a century, at a rate of very high that is faster than any other region of tropical oceans of the World. Tropical Cyclones draw their power from warm waters, which is why they form over warm pool regions where temperatures are more 28 degrees celsius. Tauktae clearly demonstrates the relationship between global warming and cycones origin. The Indian east coast and the coasts of Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka are more vulnerable to the incidence of tropical cyclones of the Bay of Bengal. The tropical cyclones wreak heavy loss of life and property in Bay of Bengal region every year.  The Global climate changes resulting from different type of anthropogenic activities are likely to noticeable itself in the weather and climate of the Bay of Bengal region also.",

         "volume": "21","number": "3","pages": "1073--1083","abstract": "In West Africa, agriculture, mainly rainfed, is a major economic sector and the one most vulnerable to climate change. A meta-database of future crop yields, built up from 16 recent studies, is used to provide an overall assessment of the potential impact of climate change on yields, and to analyze sources of uncertainty. Despite a large dispersion of yield changes ranging from â50\\% to +90\\%, the median is a yield loss near â11\\%. This negative impact is assessed by both empirical and process-based crop models whereas the Ricardian approach gives very contrasted results, even within a single study. The predicted impact is larger in northern West Africa (Sudano-Sahelian countries, â18\\% median response) than in southern West Africa (Guinean countries, â13\\%) which is likely due to drier and warmer projections in the northern part of West Africa. Moreover, negative impacts on crop productivity increase in severity as warming intensifies, with a median yield loss near â15\\% with most intense warming, highlighting the importance of global warming mitigation. The consistently negative impact of climate change results mainly from the temperature whose increase projected by climate models is much larger relative to precipitation change. However, rainfall changes, still uncertain in climate projections, have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate this impact depending on whether rainfall decreases or increases. Finally, results highlight the pivotal role that the carbon fertilization effect may have on the sign and amplitude of change in crop yields. This effect is particularly strong for a high carbon dioxide concentration scenario and for C3 crops (e.g. soybean, cassava). As staple crops are mainly C4 (e.g. maize, millet, sorghum) in WA, this positive effect is less significant for the region.",

Here we combine a tool used in numerical weather prediction, the 30 weather patterns produced by the Met Office, which are already applied operationally to numerical weather prediction models, to assess changes in the UK Climate Projections (UKCP) Global ensemble. Through assessing projected changes in the frequency of the weather patterns at the end of the 21st Century, we determine that future changes in large-scale circulation tend towards an increase in winter of weather patterns associated with cyclonic and westerly wind conditions at the expense of more anticyclonic, settled/blocked weather patterns. In summer, the results indicate a shift towards an increase in dry settled weather types with a corresponding reduction in the wet and windy weather types. Climatologically this suggests a shift towards warmer, wetter winters and warmer, drier summers; which is consistent with the headline findings from the UK Climate Projections 2018. This paper represents the first evaluation of weather patterns analysis within UKCP Global. It provides a detailed assessment of the changes in these weather patterns through the 21st Century and how uncertainty in emissions, structural and perturbed parameters affects these results. We show that the use of these weather patterns in tandem with the UKCP projections is useful for future work investigating changes in a range of weather-related climate features such as extreme precipitation.",

Results of 250 years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reflecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation-related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90% and 78% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand specific issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration. Despite the long generation times, the strong background in quantitative genetics and growing genomic resources make forest trees useful species for climate change research. The greatest adaptive response is expected when populations are large, have high genetic variability, selection is strong, and there is ecological opportunity for establishment of better adapted genotypes.",

We have separated the &#8216;dynamic&#8217; and &#8216;thermodynamic&#8217; components of the mean and extreme precipitation changes projected in 6 climate model experiments. The dynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric motion, while the thermodynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric moisture content. The model results consistently show that there are areas with small change or decreases in the thermodynamic change for mean precipitation mainly over subtropics, while the thermodynamic change for extreme precipitation is an overall increase as a result of increased atmospheric moisture. The dynamic changes play a secondary role in the difference between mean and extreme and are limited to lower latitudes. Over many parts of mid- to high latitudes, mean and extreme precipitation increase in comparable magnitude due to a comparable thermodynamic increase.",

A central element of this network of activity is the climate information website (CIW) that has seen a rapid and organic growth, yet with variable content and quality, and unfettered by any code of practice. This builds an ethical\u2013epistemic dilemma that warrants assessment as the presence of CIWs contribute to real\u2010world consequences and commitment. This study considers the context of CIW growth, and reviews a representative sample of CIWs to draw out key issues for consideration in CIW development. We assess content, function, and use\u2010case value through a dual approach of a typology and user experience narratives to evaluate the general efficacy of a CIW. The typology reveals strong contrasts in content, complicated interfaces, and an overload of choice making it difficult to converge on a stable outcome. The narratives capture user experience and highlight barriers that include navigation difficulties, jargon laden content, minimal or opaque guidance, and inferred information without context about uncertainty and limits to skill. This illuminates four concerns: (1) the ethics of information provision in a context of real\u2010world consequences; (2) interfaces that present barriers to achieving robust solutions; (3) weak capacity of both users and providers to identify information of value from the multimodel and multimethod data; and (4) inclusion of data that infer skill. Nonetheless, results provide a positive indication of a community of practice that is still maturing.",

Here we explore whether negative emissions are indeed effective in reversing climate change on human timescales, given the potentially counteracting effect of natural carbon sinks and the inertia of the climate system. We designed a range of CO 2 emission scenarios, which follow a gradual transition to a zero-carbon energy system and entail implementation of various amounts of net-negative emissions at technologically plausible rates. These scenarios are used to force an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity. Results suggest that while it is possible to revert to a desired level of warming (e.g. 2 Â°C above pre-industrial) after different levels of overshoot, thermosteric sea level rise is not reversible for at least several centuries, even under assumption of large amounts of negative CO 2 emissions. During the net-negative emission phase, artificial CO 2 removal is opposed by CO 2 outgassing from natural carbon sinks, with the efficiency of CO 2 removal\u2014here defined as the drop in atmospheric CO 2 per unit negative emission\u2014decreasing with the total amount of negative emissions.",

Understanding the processes of individual adaptation as well as public reaction to and evaluation of policy defined adaptation strategies in this matter is a challenging field of research.<p>We address this issue by developing a spatially explicit multi-agent simulation model for the Northern Hesse region located in the centre of Germany. Agents represent households that are grouped according to their social differentiation by lifestyles. In addition to geographically differentiated, demographicaleconomic data, simulations are based on empirically gained data on individual's perceptions of both local opportunities and restrictions that are derived from several scenarios of climate change.<p>We focus on an explicit representation of the individual perceptions of climate change impacts through e.g. immediate climate perception or its media coverage, opinion formation by exchange through social networks or experienced limitations in personal behavioural options and achievable goals. These perceptions differ in their impact on an actor's overall satisfaction also depending on its lifestyle. Several domains of behaviour like individual transportation, health and compliance with legal and informational instruments are integrated.<p>As a result we expect the identification of anxious or dissatisfied population groups that require additional adaptation measures and such where current and planned strategies perform well. Results will be used to inform policy makers and stakeholders about the interplay of barriers and incentives regarding the individual action of adaption to climate change and their trajectories until 2030.",

Climate change scenarios were developed for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (ETo), considering 17 General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations to better understand the range of possible future change. They were constructed by transferring the extracted climate change signals to the observed series using a frequency perturbation downscaling approach, which accounts for the changes in rainfall extremes. Projected changes under two future SRES emission scenarios A1B and B1 for the 2050s were considered. Two conceptual hydrological models were calibrated and used for the impact assessment. Their difference in simulating the flows under future climate scenarios was also investigated. <br><br> The results reveal increasing mean runoff and extreme peak flows for Nyando catchment for the 2050s while unclear trend is observed for Lake Tana catchment for mean volumes and high/low flows. The hydrological models for Lake Tana catchment, however, performed better in simulating the hydrological regimes than for Nyando, which obviously also induces a difference in the reliability of the extreme future projections for both catchments. The unclear impact result for Lake Tana catchment implies that the GCM uncertainty is more important for explaining the unclear trend than the hydrological models uncertainty. Nevertheless, to have a better understanding of future impact, hydrological models need to be verified for their credibility of simulating extreme flows.",

Projections of the effects of climate change on allergic asthma: the contribution of aerobiology. Allergy 2010; 65: 1073\u20131081. Abstract Climate change is unequivocal and represents a possible threat for patients affected by allergic conditions. It has already had an impact on living organisms, including plants and fungi with current scenarios projecting further effects by the end of the century. Over the last three decades, studies have shown changes in production, dispersion and allergen content of pollen and spores, which may be region- and species-specific. In addition, these changes may have been influenced by urban air pollutants interacting directly with pollen. Data suggest an increasing effect of aeroallergens on allergic patients over this period, which may also imply a greater likelihood of the development of an allergic respiratory disease in sensitized subjects and exacerbation of symptomatic patients. There are a number of limitations that make predictions uncertain, and further and specifically designed studies are needed to clarify current effects and future scenarios. We recommend: More stress on pollen/spore exposure in the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of respiratory and allergic diseases; collection of aerobiological data in a structured way at the European level; creation, promotion and support of multidisciplinary research teams in this area; lobbying the European Union and other funders to finance this research.",

We study two methodological issues here. First, we compare criteria for selecting the best model among 16 GEV models that allow nonstationary scale and location parameters. Simulation results showed that both the corrected Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) always detected nonstationarity, but the BIC selected the correct model more often except in very small samples. Second, we examined confidence intervals (CIs) for model parameters and other quantities such as the return levels that are usually required for hydrological and climatological time series. Four bootstrap CIs\u2014normal, percentile, basic and bias-corrected and accelerated\u2014constructed by random-t resampling, fixed-t resampling and the parametric bootstrap methods were compared. CIs for parameters of the stationary model do not present major differences. CIs for the more extreme quantiles tend to become very wide for all bootstrap methods. For nonstationary GEV models with linear time dependence of location or log-linear time dependence of scale, CI coverage probabilities are reasonably accurate for the parameters. For the extreme percentiles, the bias-corrected and accelerated method is best overall, and the fixed-t method also has good average coverage probabilities. A case study is presented of annual maximum daily precipitation over the mountainous Mesochora catchment in Greece. Analysis of historical data and data generated under two climate scenarios (control run and climate change) supported a stationary GEV model reducing to the Gumbel distribution.

Future changes of PET are likely to be as important as changes in precipitation patterns in determining changes in river flows. However PET is not calculated routinely by climate models so it must be derived independently when the impact of climate change on river flow is to be assessed. This paper compares PET estimates from twelve equations of different complexity, driven by the Hadley Centre's HadRM3-Q0 model outputs representative of 1961\u20131990, with MORECS PET, a product used as reference PET in Great Britain. The results show that the FAO56 version of the Penman-Monteith equations reproduce best the spatial and seasonal variability of MORECS PET across GB when driven by HadRM3-Q0 estimates of relative humidity, total cloud, wind speed and linearly bias-corrected mean surface temperature. This suggests that potential biases in HadRM3-Q0 climate do not result in significant biases when the physically-based FAO56 equations are used. Percentage changes in PET between the 1961\u20131990 and 2041\u20132070 time slices were also calculated for each of the twelve PET equations. Results show a large variation in the magnitude (and sometimes direction) of changes estimated from different PET equations, with Turc, Jensen-Hense and calibrated Blaney-Criddle methods systematically projecting the largest increases across GB for all months and Priestley-Taylor, Makkink and Thornthwaite showing the smallest changes. We recommend the use of the FAO56 equation as when driven by HadRM3-Q0 climate data this best reproduces the reference MORECS PET across Great Britain for the reference period of 1961\u20131990. Further, the future changes of PET estimated by FAO56 are within the range of uncertainty defined by the ensemble of twelve PET equations. The changes show a clear northwest-southeast gradient of PET increase with largest (smallest) changes in the northwest in January (July and October) respectively. However, the range in magnitude of PET changes due to the choice of PET method shown in this study for Great Britain suggests that PET uncetainty is perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing the assessment of climate change impact on hydrology.",

This study uses survey data from nations of the European Union to examine sociodemographic differences among individuals and national differences in levels and processes of support for nuclear energy. Results based on multilevel models for 27 to 29 European nations reveal relatively low support for nuclear energy, even among those concerned about climate change, but consistent patterns of determinants. At the individual level, high socioeconomic status tends to increase support for nuclear energy. At the national level, the presence of operating nuclear power plants in a country leads to higher public support. Both these results more strongly support arguments focusing on the importance of familiarity with the technology than arguments focusing on postmaterialist values. In addition, rightist political views increase support for nuclear energy, but political divisions prove particularly important in high-income nations with postmaterialist values.",

A well validated control simulation, agreement among ensemble members, and a physical understanding of the future climate change enhance confidence in the predictions. The regional model ensembles produce consistent precipitation projections over much of northern tropical Africa. A moisture budget analysis is used to identify the circulation changes that support future precipitation anomalies. The projected midsummer drought over the Guinean Coast region is related partly to weakened monsoon flow. Since the rainfall maximum demonstrates a southward bias in the control simulation in July\u2013August, this may be indicative of future summer drying over the Sahel. Wetter conditions in late summer over the Sahel are associated with enhanced moisture transport by the West African westerly jet, a strengthening of the jet itself, and moisture transport from the Mediterranean. Severe drought in East Africa during August and September is accompanied by a weakened Indian monsoon and Somali jet. Simulations with projected and idealized SST forcing suggest that overall SST warming in part supports this regional model ensemble agreement, although changes in SST gradients are important over West Africa in spring and fall. Simulations which isolate the role of individual climate forcings suggest that the spatial distribution of the rainfall predictions is controlled by the anomalous SST and lateral boundary conditions, while CO 2 forcing within the regional model domain plays an important secondary role and generally produces wetter conditions.",

We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible  \u201D tipping point,\u201D beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable.",

         "volume": "211","abstract": "Wheat is one of the main grains produced across the globe and wheat yields are sensitive to changes in climate. Australia is a major exporter of wheat, and variations in its national production influence trade supplies and global markets. We evaluated the effect of climate change in 2030 compared to a baseline period (1980-1999) by upscaling from farm to the national level. Wheat yields and gross margins under current and projected climates were assessed using current technology and management practices and then compared with `best adapted' yield achieved by adjustments to planting date, nitrogen fertilizer, and available cultivars for each region. For the baseline climate (1980-1999), there was a potential yield gap modelled as optimized adaptation gave potential up scaled yields (tonne/ha) and gross margins (AUD \\\\$/ha) of 17\\% and 33\\% above the baseline, respectively. In 2030 and at Australian wheatbelt level, climate change impact projected to decline wheat yield by 1\\%. For 2030, national wheat yields were simulated to decrease yields by 1\\\\ when using existing technology and practices but increase them by 18\\\\ assuming optimal adaptation. Hence, nationally at 2030 for a fully-adapted wheat system, yield increased by 1\\% and gross margin by 0.3\\% compared to the fully adapted current climate baseline. However, there was substantial regional variation with median yields and gross margins decreasing in 55\\% of sites. Full adaptation of farm systems under current climate is not expected, and so this will remain an on-going challenge. However, by 2030 there will be a greater opportunity to increase the overall water use and nitrogen efficiencies of the Australian wheat belt, mostly resulting from elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

         "volume": "2","number": "6","pages": "851--870","abstract": "Indices for climate variability and extremes have been used for a long time, often by assessing days with temperature or precipitation observations above or below specific physically-based thresholds. While these indices provided insight into local conditions, few physically based thresholds have relevance in all parts of the world. Therefore, indices of extremes evolved over time and now often focus on relative thresholds that describe features in the tails of the distributions of meteorological variables. In order to help understand how extremes are changing globally, a subset of the wide range of possible indices is now being coordinated internationally which allows the results of studies from different parts of the world to fit together seamlessly. This paper reviews these as well as other indices of extremes and documents the obstacles to robustly calculating and analyzing indices and the methods developed to overcome these obstacles. Gridding indices are necessary in order to compare observations with climate model output. However, gridding indices from daily data are not always straightforward because averaging daily information from many stations tends to dampen gridded extremes. The paper describes recent progress in attribution of the changes in gridded indices of extremes that demonstrates human influence on the probability of extremes. The paper also describes model projections of the future and wraps up with a discussion of ongoing efforts to refine indices of extremes as they are being readied to contribute to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report.

This provides insight into the importance of RCM formulation in representing changes in climate extremes at high spatial resolution. The models concerned are two recent Hadley Centre RCMs, HadRM2 and HadRM3, and are applied at a horizontal resolution of approximately 50 km over Europe, nested within the Hadley Centre coupled Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM), HadCM2. The simulation periods are thirty years with fixed concentrations of greenhouse gases representing the climate of 1961\u20131990 and twenty years representing transient climate change for 2080\u20132100. The use of common boundary conditions to drive the two RCMs allows us to determine whether their different formulations significantly alter the downscaled projections. The RCM simulations of precipitation extremes are compared with observations from a dense rain-gauge network over Great Britain, aggregated to the grid used by the RCMs. Both RCMs simulate realistically extreme precipitation occurring over timescales of one to thirty days and for return periods of two to twenty years. In particular, relative errors in the magnitude of extreme precipitation are generally no larger than those in the mean. The two regional models show different patterns of errors for daily precipitation extremes, with the main difference in the western and upland areas of Great Britain where they are underestimated in HadRM2 and overestimated in HadRM3. Change in extremes over all land areas in the domain show increases in intensity everywhere (except for the Iberian peninsula and Mediterranean coast) with most of these significant at the 5\\% level. Projected increases are greatest for those extremes which are the rarest and shortest duration (i.e. the most intense), both in relative and thus absolute terms. The large-scale patterns of these changes are very similar in the two RCMs implying they are generally robust to the RCM formulation changes. Given the demonstrated quality of the models this enhances our confidence in the projected changes and suggests that they are mainly conditioned by the large-scale response in the driving GCM.

It is indicated from the comparison of the simulated baseline climate with in situ observation that PRECIS can simulate the local distribution characteristics of surface air temperature over China quite well; generally speaking, the simulation for precipitation in the north of China and in winter is better than in the south of China and in summer, respectively; the simulation of precipitation in summer is sensitive to topography, and the simulated precipitation values are lower than observations over southeast coastal areas. It is shown from the analyses on the simulated climate change responses in 2080s under SRES B2 scenario relative to base-line that there would be an obvious surface air temperature increase in the north of China relative to that in the south of China, and especially in Northwest China and Northeast China, the amplitude of summer mean surface air temperature increments could reach 5Â°C; there would be an overall increase of the simulated precipitation in 2080s under SRES B2 scenario over most areas of China, while there would be significant precipitation decreases in South China in winter; there would be obvious precipitation decreases in Northeast China and North China in summer with high surface air temperature increase. However, it presents an obvious precipitation increase over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in summer.",

While these indices provided insight into local conditions, few physically based thresholds have relevance in all parts of the world. Therefore, indices of extremes evolved over time and now often focus on relative thresholds that describe features in the tails of the distributions of meteorological variables. In order to help understand how extremes are changing globally, a subset of the wide range of possible indices is now being coordinated internationally which allows the results of studies from different parts of the world to fit together seamlessly. This paper reviews these as well as other indices of extremes and documents the obstacles to robustly calculating and analyzing indices and the methods developed to overcome these obstacles. Gridding indices are necessary in order to compare observations with climate model output. However, gridding indices from daily data are not always straightforward because averaging daily information from many stations tends to dampen gridded extremes. The paper describes recent progress in attribution of the changes in gridded indices of extremes that demonstrates human influence on the probability of extremes. The paper also describes model projections of the future and wraps up with a discussion of ongoing efforts to refine indices of extremes as they are being readied to contribute to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report.

Prior research was searched using several general and discipline-specific research databases. The review concludes that whereas there is little original research on the impacts of climate change on aeroallergens and other naturally derived particulates in Australia, or the human health consequences of these, research from overseas suggests that these impacts may be adverse and of considerable magnitude. More research is required to assess the impacts of climate change on these airborne particles and associated diseases in Australia and other parts of the Asia-Pacific. There are important policy implications of this review. There is a need for enhanced monitoring of the atmospheric environment and associated health conditions in Australia. Education about climate change and human health in general, and air quality and related diseases specifically, is required for the community, health professionals, and others. Improvements are needed in the preparedness of infrastructure, such as health care facilities and early warning systems, particularly for aeroallergens, and all of these adaptive policy responses require further research.",

Previous studies showed that the American public misinterprets these probabilistic statements. We report results from a multi-national study involving 25 samples in 24 countries and 17 languages. As predicted, laypeople interpret IPCC statements as conveying probabilities closer to 50\\% than intended by the IPCC authors. We show that an alternative presentation format supplementing the verbal terms with numerical ranges increases the correspondence between the public's interpretations and the IPCC guidelines, and the terms are better differentiated. These qualitative patterns are remarkably stable across all samples and languages. In fact, interpretations of the terms in various languages are more similar under the new presentation format. These results suggest changing the way the IPCC communicates uncertainty.",

However, the scientific models, because they omit key factors that are hard to capture precisely, appear to substantially underestimate these risks. Many economic models add further gross underassessment of risk because the assumptions built into the economic modeling on growth, damages and risks, come close to assuming directly that the impacts and costs will be modest and close to excluding the possibility of catastrophic outcomes. A new generation of models is needed in all three of climate science, impact and economics with a still stronger focus on lives and livelihoods, including the risks of large-scale migration and conflicts.",

That hopeful picture is of a world in which inequalities -- among and within nations -- have been substantially reduced. The challenges and adjustments confronting humanity in the coming decades provide an opportunity that could be used to mitigate climate change in ways that can improve the circumstances of the poor. Ecological reasons to reduce throughput of energy and materials in economic systems urge the abandonment of high-consumption life-styles. The 21st century will be an era of many losses, but it is conceivable that societies will successfully make the transition from goals of economic growth, as understood in the 20th century, to goals of maintaining and increasing sustainable well-being.",

This is based on a set of ensemble simulations of equilibrium and time-dependent changes, carried out by perturbing poorly constrained parameters controlling key physical and biogeochemical processes in the HadCM3 coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere global climate model. These (ongoing) experiments allow quantification of the effects of earth system modelling uncertainties and internal climate variability on feedbacks likely to exert a significant influence on twenty-first century climate at large regional scales. A further ensemble of regional climate simulations at 25\u200Akm resolution is being produced for Europe, allowing the specification of probabilistic predictions at spatial scales required for studies of climate impacts. The ensemble simulations are processed using a set of statistical procedures, the centrepiece of which is a Bayesian statistical framework designed for use with complex but imperfect models. This supports the generation of probabilities constrained by a wide range of observational metrics, and also by expert-specified prior distributions defining the model parameter space. The Bayesian framework also accounts for additional uncertainty introduced by structural modelling errors, which are estimated using our ensembles to predict the results of alternative climate models containing different structural assumptions. This facilitates the generation of probabilistic predictions combining information from perturbed physics and multi-model ensemble simulations. The methodology makes extensive use of emulation and scaling techniques trained on climate model results. These are used to sample the equilibrium response to doubled carbon dioxide at any required point in the parameter space of surface and atmospheric processes, to sample time-dependent changes by combining this information with ensembles sampling uncertainties in the transient response of a wider set of earth system processes, and to sample changes at local scales.",

Empirical models have linked a large part of this increase in wave height with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Wave models provide a tool to study impacts of various climate change scenarios and investigate physical explanations of statistical results. In this case we use a wave model of the NE Atlantic. Model tests were carried out, using synthetic wind fields, varying the strength of the prevailing westerly winds and the frequency and intensity of storms, the location of storm tracks and the storm propagation speed. The strength of the westerly winds is most effective at increasing mean and maximum monthly wave height. The frequency, intensity, track and speed of storms have little effect on the mean wave height but intensity, track and speed significantly affect maximum wave height.",

Impacts on agriculture, forestry, water resources, and energy, were emphasized. The study was future-oriented, focusing on the year 2030, by which time the effects of 'greenhouse' warming may be felt. The records of the AD 1930s were used to provide an analog of the kinds of climate change (warmer and drier) that climate models predict will occur in the MINK region. Our results indicate that impacts of the projected climate change on agriculture, at least in the future, are expected to be profound, but that likely-to-be available technologies should facilitate substantial adaptation; that current water-resource limitations in the region would be exacerbated and lead to an eastward shift in irrigation; that impacts on forestry would be severe, and that opportunities for forestry adaptation would be very limited unless biomass production were to become economically viable; and that the net impacts on energy supply and demand would be small and adaptation to them relatively simple. Climate change in the MINK region could, of course, go somewhat beyond the conditions represented by the AD 1930s analog, in which case the findings of this study may be too optimistic. However, the future-oriented 'MINK methodology' is not scenario-dependent, and can be used to test other, more severe (or benign), scenarios as well. Further, the capacity for adaptation to climate change demonstrated in this study, may remain applicable even in more stringent circumstances",

This complexity limits our ability to incorporate fire into Earth system models and project future fire activity under climate change. Conceptual, empirical, and process models have identified the mechanisms and processes driving fire regimes, and provide a useful basis to consider future fire activity. However, these models generally deal with only one component of fire regimes, fire frequency, and do not incorporate feedbacks between fire, vegetation, and climate. They are thus unable to predict the location, severity or timing of fires, the socioecological impacts of fire regime change, or potential non-linear responses such as biome shifts into alternative stable states. Dynamic modeling experiments may facilitate more thorough investigations of fire\u2013vegetation\u2013climate feedbacks and interactions, but their success will depend on the development of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) that more accurately represent biological drivers. This requires improvements in the representation of current vegetation, plant responses to fire, ecological dynamics, and land management to capture the mechanisms behind fire frequency, intensity, and timing. DGVMs with fire modules are promising tools to develop a globally consistent analysis of fire activity, but projecting future fire activity will ultimately require a transdisciplinary synthesis of the biological, atmospheric, and socioeconomic drivers of fire. This is an important goal because fire causes substantial economic disruption and contributes to future climate change through its influence on albedo and the capacity of the biosphere to store carbon.

Since the 1950s, the principal tools of climate science have been computer simulation models of the global general circulation. From the 1990s to the present, a trend toward increasingly comprehensive coupled models of the entire climate system has dominated the field. Climate model evaluation and intercomparison is changing modeling into a more standardized, modular process, presenting the potential for unifying research and operational aspects of climate science.

We used a perturbed-parameter crop modelling method together with a regional climate model (PRECIS) driven by the 2071\u20132100 SRES A2 emissions scenario in order to examine processes and uncertainties in yield simulation. Crop simulations used the groundnut (i.e. peanut;  Arachis hypogaea  L.) version of the General Large-Area Model for annual crops (GLAM). Two sets of GLAM simulations were carried out: control simulations and fixed-duration simulations, where the impact of mean temperature on crop development rate was removed. Model results were compared to sensitivity tests using two other crop models of differing levels of complexity: CROPGRO, and the groundnut model of Hammer et al. Hammer, G.L., Sinclair, T.R., Boote, K.J., Wright, G.C., Meinke, H., and Bell, M.J., 1995, A peanut simulation model: I. Model development and testing. Agron. J. 87, 1085\u20131093. GLAM simulations were particularly sensitive to two processes. First, elevated vapour pressure deficit (VPD) consistently reduced yield. The same result was seen in some simulations using both other crop models. Second, GLAM crop duration was longer, and yield greater, when the optimal temperature for the rate of development was exceeded. Yield increases were also seen in one other crop model. Overall, the models differed in their response to super-optimal temperatures, and that difference increased with mean temperature; percentage changes in yield between current and future climates were as diverse as  â50 \\% and over  +30 \\% for the same input data. The first process has been observed in many crop experiments, whilst the second has not. Thus, we conclude that there is a need for: (i) more process-based modelling studies of the impact of VPD on assimilation, and (ii) more experimental studies at super-optimal temperatures. Using the GLAM results, central values and uncertainty ranges were projected for mean 2071\u20132100 crop yields in India. In the fixed-duration simulations, ensemble mean yields mostly rose by 10\u201330\\%. The full ensemble range was greater than this mean change (20\u201360\\% over most of India). In the control simulations, yield stimulation by elevated CO 2  was more than offset by other processes \u2013 principally accelerated crop development rates at elevated, but sub-optimal, mean temperatures. Hence, the quantification of uncertainty can facilitate relatively robust indications of the likely sign of crop yield changes in future climates.",

Several consistent changes were observed across all four realizations for the seasonal means: robust increase of U10 and Hs in the Southern Ocean for both the austral summer and winter due to the poleward shift of the jet stream; a dipole pattern of the U10 and Hs with increases in the northeast sector and decreases at the midlatitude during boreal winter in the North Atlantic due to the more frequent occurrence of the positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); and strong decrease of U10 and Hs in the tropical western Pacific Ocean during austral summer, which might be caused by the joint effect of the weakening of the Walker circulation and the large hurricane frequency decrease in the South Pacific. Changes of the 99th percentile U10 and Hs are twice as strong as changes in the seasonal means, and the maximum changes are mainly dominated by the changes in hurricanes. Robust strong decreases of U10 and Hs in the South Pacific are obtained because of the large hurricane frequency decrease, while the results in the Northern Hemisphere basins differ among the models. An additional sensitivity experiment suggests that the qualitative response of U10 and Hs is not affected by using SST anomalies only and maintaining the radiative forcing unchanged (using 1980 values), as in this study.",

Adopting a socio-analytical perspective, it contemplates the possibility of a societal level \u2018cosmology episode\u2019 caused by catastrophic climate change; a critical point of rupture in the meaning-making process which leaves local rationalities in ruin. Drawing on a \u2018representative anecdote\u2019, the article finds allegorical parallels between the cultural collapse of a traditional indigenous culture and the impending threat of ecocrisis currently facing humanity. The possibilities of seeing and imagining offered by collective forms of dreaming are explored alongside development of a non-anthropocentric ethics. Our focus is on ways of sensing, thinking and talking about climate change that are less dependent on a rational conscious subject. The article thus enquires into what cultural means or resources might be available to (post)modern Western societies that, like the shamanic dream-vision of certain traditional cultures, might enable them to draw on non-anthropocentric sensibilities and organize responses to an impending cultural crisis. We conclude by offering Gordon Lawrence\u2019s social dreaming matrix as one possible medium through which to imagine and see beyond climate change catastrophe.",

These two separate but related debates point to the centrality of modern science in political discussions of the environment and to the difficulties, simultaneously technical and political, in warranting political action in the face of inevitably partial and uncertain scientific knowledge. The case of climate change then provides an experimental test case with which to explore the various responses to these challenges offered by Ulrich Beck's reflexive modernization, the normative theory of expertise advanced by Harry Collins and Robert Evans, and Bruno Latour's utopian vision for decision-making by the 'collective' in which traditional epistemic and institutional distinctions between science and politics are entirely superseded.",

This workshop is placed in the context of recent international agreements including the Paris Agreement, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and ongoing preparation for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that converge on solving the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss as essential to support human well-being. The Scientific Outcome further develops and substantiates the conclusions of the Synopsis, summarizes the emerging state of knowledge involving climate change and biodiversity with the objective to inform decision making and highlight options for action, and to identify knowledge gaps to be filled by scientific research. The Scientific Outcome includes seven sections, the references outlining the evidence reviewed within those sections and the report glossary.",

Other parts of the food system contribute carbon dioxide emissions that emanate from the use of fossil fuels in transportation, processing, retailing, storage, and preparation. Food items differ substantially when GHG emissions are calculated from farm to table. A recent study of â20 items sold in Sweden showed a span of 0.4 to 30 kg CO2 equivalents/kg edible product. For protein-rich food, such as legumes, meat, fish, cheese, and eggs, the difference is a factor of 30 with the lowest emissions per kilogram for legumes, poultry, and eggs and the highest for beef, cheese, and pork. Large emissions for ruminants are explained mainly by methane emissions from enteric fermentation. For vegetables and fruits, emissions usually are â¤2.5 kg CO2 equivalents/kg product, even if there is a high degree of processing and substantial transportation. Products transported by plane are an exception because emissions may be as large as for certain meats. Emissions from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as potatoes, pasta, and wheat, are <1.1 kg/kg edible food. We suggest that changes in the diet toward more plant-based foods, toward meat from animals with little enteric fermentation, and toward foods processed in an energy-efficient manner offer an interesting and little explored area for mitigating climate change.",

Even then, significant changes are indicated only in the SW of the domain and across the central Baltic Sea where there is some evidence for relatively small magnitude increases in the 50Â year return period wind speed (of up to 15\\%). There are marked differences in results based on the two Regional Climate Models. Additionally, internal (inherent) variability and initial conditions exert a strong impact on projected wind climates throughout the twenty-first century. Simulations of wind gusts by one of the RCMs (RCA3) indicate some evidence for increased magnitudes (of up to +10\\%) in the southwest of the domain and across the central Baltic Sea by the end of the current century. As in prior downscaling of ECHAM4, dynamical downscaling of ECHAM5 indicates a tendency towards increased energy density and thus wind power generation potential over the course of the C21st. However, caution should be used in interpreting this inference given the high degree of wind climate projection spread that derives from the specific AOGCM and RCM used in the downscaling.",

The molecular mechanisms by which air pollutants and climate parameters may influence allergic diseases, however, are complex and elusive. This article provides an overview of physical, chemical and biological interactions between air pollution, climate change, allergens, adjuvants and the immune system, addressing how these interactions may promote the development of allergies. We reviewed and synthesized key findings from atmospheric, climate, and biomedical research. The current state of knowledge, open questions, and future research perspectives are outlined and discussed. The Anthropocene, as the present era of globally pervasive anthropogenic influence on planet Earth and, thus, on the human environment, is characterized by a strong increase of carbon dioxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and combustion- or traffic-related particulate matter in the atmosphere. These environmental factors can enhance the abundance and induce chemical modifications of allergens, increase oxidative stress in the human body, and skew the immune system toward allergic reactions. In particular, air pollutants can act as adjuvants and alter the immunogenicity of allergenic proteins, while climate change affects the atmospheric abundance and human exposure to bioaerosols and aeroallergens. To fully understand and effectively mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution and climate change on allergic diseases, several challenges remain to be resolved. Among these are the identification and quantification of immunochemical reaction pathways involving allergens and adjuvants under relevant environmental and physiological conditions.",

         "abstract": "Influential studies have predicted that moderate climate change,up to 3 or 4 degrees Fahrenheit,will not be very damaging to the United States as a whole and will bring some benefits.1 Underlying the argument that climate change will not be very damaging to the U.S.economy is the contention that vulnerable organizations,firms and households will take steps to adapt. This assumption is based partly on the fact that the United States is rich in technology, economic resources, competent organizations and educated people,all of which combine to create a high capacity to adapt. More fundamentally, the contention rests on the observation that the United States spans a wide variety of climatic conditions to which households and enterprises have adapted successfully in the past.According to a recent review, \u201D The literature indicates that U.S. society can on the whole adapt with either net gains or some costs if warming occurs at the lower end of the projected range of magnitude, assuming no change in climate variability and generally making optimistic assumptions about adaptation.\u201D2These are key assumptions.The perception that damages will be limited has been a significant factor in the conclusion reached by the U.S.government that it was not in the national interest to join in the Kyoto Protocol agreement to reduce carbon emissions because the benefits in damages averted would be small relative to the costs incurred in mitigating GHG emissions in the U.S. to the extent called for in the Protocol. Furthermore, refusal by the United States, the world's richest country and largest cumulative emitter of greenhouse gases, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol discouraged other countries from joining or implementing an international agreement to limit emissions.Consequently,assumptions regarding adaptation in the U.S.have had broad policy repercussions.Are these assumptions justified?",

Accordingly, the installed capacity of wind turbines grew at an annualized rate of >20% from 2000 to 2019 and is projected to increase by a further 50% by the end of 2023. In this Review, we describe the factors that dictate the wind resource magnitude and variability and illustrate the tools and techniques that are being used to make projections of wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions. Natural variability due to the action of internal climate modes appears to dominate over global-warming-induced non-stationarity over most areas with large wind energy installations or potential. However, there is evidence for increased wind energy resources by the end of the current century in northern Europe and the US Southern Great Plains. New technology trends are changing the sensitivity of wind energy to global climate non-stationarity and, thus, present new challenges and opportunities for innovative research. The evolution of climate modelling to increasingly address mesoscale processes is providing improved projections of both wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions, and will contribute to continued reductions in the levelized cost of energy from wind power generation.",

In addition, results from research into one of these areas (e.g., analysis of wind speed patterns) are presented as an example within the overall broader review to illustrate current and potential future avenues of investigation.

The LARS weather generator was used to provide climatic data for the baseline period (1961-90) and in combination with two regional circulation models (RCM) to generate climatic data under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B emission scenario for four different 20-year time slices (denoted by midpoints 2020, 2040, 2060 and 2080) for two locations in Denmark, differing in soil and climate, and representative of the selected production systems. The CO2 effects were modelled using projected CO2 concentrations for the A1B emission scenario. Crop rotations were irrigated (sandy soil) and unirrigated (sandy loam soil), and all included systems with and without catch crops, with field operation dates adapted to baseline and future climate change. Model projections showed an increase in the productivity and N leaching in the future that would be dependent on crop rotation and crop management, highlighting the importance of considering the whole rotation rather than single crops for impact assessments. Potato and sugar beet in arable farming and grain maize in pig farming contributed most to the productivity increase in the future scenarios. The highest productivity was obtained in the arable system on the sandy loam soil, with an increase of 20\\% on average in 2080 with respect to the baseline. Irrigation and fertilization rates would need to be increased in the future to achieve optimum yields. Growing catch crops reduces N leaching, but current catch crop management might not be sufficient to control the potential increase of leaching and more efficient strategies are required in the future. The uncertainty of climate change scenarios was assessed by using two different climate projections for predicting crop productivity and N leaching in Danish crop rotations, and this showed the consistency of the projected trends when used with the same crop model.",

The debate, empirical studies, and policy development, however, are impeded by an inconsistent articulation of the idea. The discrepancy is demonstrated by the varying use of terms, such as assisted migration, assisted colonisation, or managed relocation, and their multiple definitions. Since this conservation approach is novel, and may for instance lead to legislative changes, it is important to aim for terminological consistency. The objective of this study is to analyse the suitability of terms and definitions used when discussing the moving of organisms as a response to climate change. An extensive literature search and review of the material (868 scientific publications) was conducted for finding hitherto used terms (N = 40) and definitions (N = 75), and these were analysed for their suitability. Based on the findings, it is argued that an appropriate term for a conservation approach relating to aiding the movement of organisms harmed by climate change is assisted migration defined as follows: Assisted migration means safeguarding biological diversity through the translocation of representatives of a species or population harmed by climate change to an area outside the indigenous range of that unit where it would be predicted to move as climate changes, were it not for anthropogenic dispersal barriers or lack of time. The differences between assisted migration and other conservation translocations are also discussed. A wide adoption of the clear and distinctive term and definition provided would allow more focused research on the topic and enable consistent implementation as practitioners could have the same understanding of the concept.",

A goal for the Fifth Assessment Report, which is currently under development, is the application of a common framework with associated calibrated uncertainty language that can be used to characterize findings of the assessment process. A guidance note for authors of the Fifth Assessment Report has been developed that describes this common approach and language, building upon the guidance employed in past Assessment Reports. Here, we introduce the main features of this guidance note, with a focus on how it has been designed for use by author teams. We also provide perspectives on considerations and challenges relevant to the application of this guidance in the contribution of each Working Group to the Fifth Assessment Report. Despite the wide spectrum of disciplines encompassed by the three Working Groups, we expect that the framework of the new uncertainties guidance will enable consistent communication of the degree of certainty in their policy-relevant assessment findings.",

Partially migratory populations are populations that consist of both migratory and residential individuals. Such populations are very common, yet their stability has long been debated. The inheritance of migratory activity is currently best described by the threshold model of quantitative genetics. The inclusion of such a genetic threshold model for migratory behavior leads to a stable zone in time and space of partially migratory populations under a wide range of demographic parameter values, when assuming stable environmental conditions and unlimited genetic diversity. Migratory species are expected to be particularly sensitive to global warming, as arrival at the breeding grounds might be increasingly mistimed as a result of the uncoupling of long-used cues and actual environmental conditions, with decreasing reproduction as a consequence. Here, we investigate the consequences for migratory behavior and the stability of partially migratory populations under five climate change scenarios and the assumption of a genetic threshold value for migratory behavior in an individual-based model. The results show a spatially and temporally stable zone of partially migratory populations after different lengths of time in all scenarios. In the scenarios in which the species expands its range from a particular set of starting populations, the genetic diversity and location at initialization determine the species\u2019 colonization speed across the zone of partial migration and therefore across the entire landscape. Abruptly changing environmental conditions after model initialization never caused a qualitative change in phenotype distributions, or complete extinction. This suggests that climate change-induced shifts in species\u2019 ranges as well as changes in survival probabilities and reproductive success can be met with flexibility in migratory behavior at the species level, which will reduce the risk of extinction.",

The analysis focuses on the regional scale, and in particular on 21 regions covering all land areas in the World (except Antarctica). We examine seasonally averaged surface air temperature and precipitation for the historical period of 1961\u20131990 and the future climate period of 2046\u20132075. Compared to previous AOGCM simulations, the HADCM2 model shows a good performance in reproducing observed regional averages of summer and winter temperature and precipitation. The model, however, does not reproduce well observed interannual variability. We find that the uncertainty in regional climate change predictions associated with the spread of different realizations in an ensemble (i.e. the uncertainty related to the internal model variability) is relatively low for all scenarios and regions. In particular, this uncertainty is lower than the uncertainty due to inter-scenario variability and (by comparison with previous regional analyses of AOGCMs) with inter-model variability. The climate biases and sensitivities found for different realizations of the same ensemble were similar to the corresponding ensemble averages and the averages associated with individual realizations of the same ensemble did not differ from each other at the 5\\% confidence level in the vast majority of cases. These results indicate that a relatively small number of realizations (3 or 4) is sufficient to characterize an AOGCM transient climate change prediction at the regional scale.",

The methodology of discourse analysis has been applied to investigate the changing perceptions of climate change over time and the ways in which it became an important issue on Germany's political agenda. The first part of the paper will briefly introduce the underlying theoretical assumptions and explain the multiple steps by which data covering a period of two decades have been collected and analyzed. In the second part, the paper will provide the reader with the main research results, indicating the usefulness of distinguishing among the separate discourses on climate change in science, politics, and the mass media. The results suggest that there are specific discourse dynamics common to each of the three spheres, as well as some important disparities among them. These findings will be illustrated by a selection of examples typical of the samples analyzed. Finally, the third part of the paper will discuss the broader theoretical and practical implications of these results, which suggest that modern societies must cope not only with environmental risks but also with the risks inherent in communication.",

The main downscaling differences considered were on the rainfall variable while a generally similar method was applied for temperature. The applied downscaling methods are a stochastic weather generator, LARS-WG, and an advanced change factor method, the Quantile Perturbation Method (QPM). These were applied on 10 GCM runs and two emission scenarios (A1B and B1). The downscaled rainfall and evapotranspiration were input into a calibrated and validated lumped conceptual model. The future simulations were conducted for 2050s and 2090s horizon and were compared with 1980\u20132000 control period. From the results all downscaling methods agree in projecting increase in temperature for both periods. Nevertheless, the change signal on the rainfall was dependent on the climate model and the downscaling method applied. LARS weather generator was good for monthly statistics although caution has to be taken when it is applied for impact analysis dealing with extremes, as it showed a deviation from the extreme value distribution's tail shape. Contrary, the QPM method was good for extreme cases but only for good quality daily climate model data. The study showed the choice of downscaling method is an important factor to be considered and results based on one downscaling method may not give the full picture. Regardless, the projections on the extreme high flows and the mean main rainy season flow mostly showed a decreasing change signal for both periods. This is either by decreasing rainfall or increasing evapotranspiration depending on the downscaling method.",

Investigating how species responded to historic climate fluctuations may\nprovide critical insights into a species\u2019 response to current climate change. Despite their ecological diversity, shark\nspecies share many similar life history characteristics and may be especially vulnerable to anthropogenic and climate\nimpacts. We compared patterns of genetic variability, mismatch distributions and demographic reconstructions from coalescence approaches among temperate and tropi-\ncal shark species with differing ecological characteristics, to investigate the effect of the past glaciation cycles on\npopulation abundance. Genetic diversity at two mitochondrial DNA regions (ND2 and control region) was assayed\nin four North Pacific species, Pacific spiny dogfish, Pacific sleeper sharks, salmon shark, and bluntnose sixgill shark.\nIn addition, control region sequences acquired from GenBank for five shark species tope shark (California/\nAustralia), white shark (California), blacktip shark (eastern and western Gulf of Mexico), lemon shark (Bahamas), and\nwhale shark were analyzed. General patterns in genetic diversity, mismatch analyses and Bayesian skyline plots\nsupported our hypothesis that species biology affected the impact of climate variation on demographic history. Consequently, our results suggest that effects of contemporary climate change on sharks may be to some degree predict- able from species biology, distribution, habitat and the impact of past climate events.",

The structure, geographic distribution and seasonal variability of the model tropical storms show some similarities with observations. The simulation of tropical storms is better in this high-resolution experiment than in a parallel standard resolution experiment. In an anomaly experiment, sea ice, SSTs and greenhouse-gas forcing are changed to mimic the changes that occur in a coupled model as greenhouse-gases are increased. There are more tropical storms in this experiment than in the control experiment in the Northeast Pacific and Indian Ocean basins and fewer in the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific and Southwest Pacific region. The changes in the North Atlantic and Northwest Pacific can be linked to El NiÃ±o-like behaviour. A comparison of the tracking results with two empirically derived tropical storm genesis parameters is carried out. The tracking technique and a convective genesis parameter give similar results, both in the global distribution and in the changes in the individual basins. The convective genesis parameter is also applied to parallel coupled model experiments that have a lower horizontal resolution. The changes in the global distribution of tropical storms in the coupled model experiments are consistent with the changes seen at higher resolution. This indicates that the convective genesis parameter may still provide useful information about tropical storm changes in experiments carried out with models that cannot resolve tropical storms.",

Unlike previous studies in this field, the data sample has a global coverage and special emphasis is given to the heterogeneous response of different regions and to the contrasting effects on energy demand for cooling and heating purposes. To account for this we distinguish between different regions, seasons, and energy sources. Short- and long-run temperature demand elasticities are estimated. These features make the model results especially valuable in the analysis of climate change impacts as they provide an empirical basis for the study of the impact of climate change on energy demand. To illustrate the potential of the results as a basis for the study of climate change impacts, the estimates are used in a simple exercise that projects changes in energy demand due to temperatures increase in 2085.",

In this study Northern Hemisphere storms are analysed in ensembles of time-slice experiments carried out with an atmosphere only model with present day and future anthropogenic emissions. The present day experiment is forced by observed sea-surface temperature and sea-ice. The sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice for the future experiment are derived by adding anomalies, from parallel but lower resolution coupled model experiments, to the observed data. The storms in the present day simulation compare fairly well with observations in all seasons but some errors remain. In the future simulations there is some evidence of a poleward shift in the storm tracks in some seasons and regions. There are fewer cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere in winter and spring. The northeast end of the North Atlantic storm track is shifted south in winter giving more storms and increased frequency of strong winds over the British Isles. This shift is related to an increase in baroclinicity and a southward shift of the jet that occurs as a response to a minimum in ocean warming in the central North Atlantic. An increase in the frequency of storms over the UK is likely to cause enhanced levels of wind and flood damage. These results concur with those from some other models, however, large uncertainties remain.",

The approach is based on the near-worst-case flood scenario, associated with a known tropical cyclone wind intensity probability (return period). We applied the method for the locality of Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico, using synthetic tropical cyclones derived from six different general circulation models for the present and future climates under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. The synthetic events allowed the characterization of the wind intensity for the present and future climates for a given return period, as well as to determine the key tropical cyclones parameters related to storm surge. For Hurricane Patricia (2015), the strongest tropical cyclone to impact the region, we determined that its 95Â m/s winds have a return period above 4000Â years for the present climate and 198Â years in a future climate scenario. Using Hurricane Patricia\u2019s peak wind intensity, we created hypothetical events representing all possible approaches of tropical cyclones (211 events) to Manzanillo. We forced a hydrodynamic model with the hypothetical events over a mesh created with LiDAR-derived topography and then calculated the storm surge to create the near-worst-case flood scenario based on the maximum envelopes of water (MEOWs) and the maximum of MEOWs. Using those results, we created flood risk maps at city block level based on the combination of flood hazard and socioeconomic vulnerability maps. The presented method provides a tool for tropical cyclones storm surge hazard and risk assessment by generating near-worst-case flood maps under projected climates using a limited set of hypothetical events.

Populations are currently well established and cause significant health problems in the French RhÃ´ne valley, Austria, Hungary and Croatia but transient or casual introduced populations are also found in more Northern and Eastern European countries. A process-based model of weed growth, competition and population dynamics was used to predict the future potential for range expansion of A.artemisiifolia under climate change scenarios. The model predicted a northward shift in the available climatic niche for populations to establish and persist, creating a risk of increased health problems in countries including the UK and Denmark. This was accompanied by an increase in relative pollen production at the northern edge of its range. The southern European limit for A.artemisiifolia was not expected to change; populations continued to be limited by drought stress in Spain and Southern Italy. The process-based approach to modelling the impact of climate change on plant populations has the advantage over correlative species distribution models of being able to capture interactions of climate, land use and plant competition at the local scale. However, for this potential to be fully realised, additional empirical data are required on competitive dynamics of A.artemisiifolia in different crops and ruderal plant communities and its capacity to adapt to local conditions.",

Modeling advances now provide the opportunity of utilizing global general circulation models (GCMs) for projections of extreme temperature and precipitation indicators. We analyze historical and future simulations of ten such indicators as derived from an ensemble of 9 GCMs contributing to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4), under a range of emissions scenarios. Our focus is on the consensus from the GCM ensemble, in terms of direction and significance of the changes, at the global average and geographical scale. The climate extremes described by the ten indices range from heat-wave frequency to frost-day occurrence, from dry-spell length to heavy rainfall amounts. Historical trends generally agree with previous observational studies, providing a basic sense of reliability for the GCM simulations. Individual model projections for the 21st century across the three scenarios examined are in agreement in showing greater temperature extremes consistent with a warmer climate. For any specific temperature index, minor differences appear in the spatial distribution of the changes across models and across scenarios, while substantial differences appear in the relative magnitude of the trends under different emissions rates. Depictions of a wetter world and greater precipitation intensity emerge unequivocally in the global averages of most of the precipitation indices. However, consensus and significance are less strong when regional patterns are considered. This analysis provides a first overview of projected changes in climate extremes from the IPCC-AR4 model ensemble, and has significant implications with regard to climate projections for impact assessments.",

Three hydrological models and one groundwater level model were used to derive Future Flows Hydrology, with 30 river sites simulated by two hydrological models to enable assessment of hydrological modelling uncertainty in studying the impact of climate change on the hydrology.\n\nFuture Flows Hydrology contains an 11-member ensemble of transient projections from January 1951 to December 2098, each associated with a single realisation from a different variant of HadRM3 and a single hydrological model. Daily river flows are provided for 281 river catchments and monthly groundwater levels at 24 boreholes as .csv files containing all 11 ensemble members. When separate simulations are done with two hydrological models, two separate .csv files are provided.\n\nBecause of potential biases in the climate\u2013hydrology modelling chain, catchment fact sheets are associated with each ensemble. These contain information on the uncertainty associated with the hydrological modelling when driven using observed climate and Future Flows Climate for a period representative of the reference time slice 1961\u20131990 as described by key hydrological statistics. Graphs of projected changes for selected hydrological indicators are also provided for the 2050s time slice. Limitations associated with the dataset are provided, along with practical recommendation of use.\n\nFuture Flows Hydrology is freely available for non-commercial use under certain licensing conditions. For each study site, catchment averages of daily precipitation and monthly potential evapotranspiration, used to drive the hydrological models, are made available, so that hydrological modelling uncertainty under climate change conditions can be explored further.",

This new tool provides a large-scale perspective on species' geographic distributions, ecological and historical factors determining them, and their potential for change with expected environmental changes. As a first step, the ability of this technique to predict geographic distributions of the three species was tested statistically using two subsampling techniques: a random-selection technique that simulates 50\\% data density, and a quadrant-based technique that challenges the method to predict into broad unsampled regions. Predictivity under both test schemes was highly statistically significant. Visualisation of ecological niches provided insights into the ecological basis for distributional differences among species. Projections of potential geographic distributions across scenarios of global climate change suggested that only Lutzomyia whitmani is likely to be experiencing dramatic improvements in conditions in south-eastern Brazil, where cutaneous leishmaniasis appears to be re-emerging; Lutzomyia intermedia and Lutzomyia migonei may be seeing more subtle improvements in climatic conditions, but the implications are not straightforward. More generally, this technique offers the possibility of new views into the distributional ecology of disease, vector, and reservoir species.",

Analysis of rainfall and river flow records during the 20th century demonstrates high levels of interannual and interdecadal variability. This is experienced locally and regionally in the headwater regions of the Nile and internationally through its effects on downstream Nile flows in Sudan and Egypt. Examples of climate variability are presented from areas in the basin where it exerts a strong influence on society; the Ethiopian highlands (links with food security), Lake Victoria (management of non-stationary lake levels) and Egypt (exposure to interdecadal variability of Nile flows). These examples reveal adaptations across various scales by individuals and institutions acting alongside other social and economic considerations. Water resources management in the downstream riparian Egypt has involved institutional level reactive adaptations to prolonged periods of low and high Nile flows. Observed responses include the establishment of more robust contingency planning and early warning systems alongside strategic assessment of water use and planning in response to low flows during the 1980s. In the 1990s high flows have enabled Egypt to pursue opportunistic policies to expand irrigation. These policies are embedded in wider socio-political and economic considerations but increase Egypt's exposure and sensitivity to climate driven fluctuations in Nile flows. Analysis of climate change projections for the region shows there is no clear indication of how Nile flows will be affected because of uncertainty about future rainfall patterns in the basin. In many instances the most appropriate entry point for adaptation to climate change will be coping with climate variability and will play out against the certainty of looming national water scarcity in Egypt due to rapid population growth and its possible exacerbation by water demands from upstream riparians.",

This study aims to assess how the likelihood of the event in the present-day climate has changed since 1976 because of climate change. The analysis focuses on the England and Wales region, which was particularly badly impacted. Three key factors contributing to the extreme summer were identified: the dry preceding winter\u2013spring period, the dry summer and the hot summer. Following the principles of event attribution, three methods are used to evaluate the change in event risk: one using observational data, a second using CMIP5 coupled climate models and a third using HadGEM3-A atmosphere-only simulations. This is the first time that this method has been used to evaluate how the risk of a historical extreme event has changed since it originally occurred. The results from the three methods agree qualitatively. The probability of a summer at least as hot as 1976 has increased significantly between the 1970s and the present-day climate (estimated risk ratios 11 (5\u201395\\% confidence interval (CI) 7,14), 9 (CI 4,28) and 19 (CI 5,25) based on the three respective methods). In contrast, no significant change in the probability of an extreme dry winter\u2013spring or an extreme dry summer was found. However, the joint probability of an extreme dry winter\u2013spring followed by an extreme hot summer and the probability of an extreme hot and dry summer have both increased significantly between the 1970s and the present day (estimated risk ratios between 5 and 79, and between 3 and 39, respectively). Water resource systems should therefore be robust enough to cope with more frequent occurrences of summers as extreme as 1976.",

First, a statistical downscaling method is introduced to estimate daily mean 10Â m wind speed at specific sites using general circulation model output. Daily 850Â hPa wind field has been selected as the large scale circulation predictor. The method is based on a classification of the daily wind fields into a few synoptic weather types and multiple linear regressions. Years are divided into an extended winter season from October to March and an extended summer season from April to September, and the procedure is conducted separately for each season. ERA40 reanalysis and observed station data have been used to build and validate the downscaling algorithm over France for the period 1974\u20132002. The method is then applied to 14 AOGCMs of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset. Three time periods are focused on: a historical period (1971\u20132000) from the climate of the twentieth century experiment and two climate projection periods (2046\u20132065 and 2081\u20132100) from the IPCC SRES A1B experiment. Evolution of the 10Â m wind speed in France and associated uncertainties are discussed. Significant changes are depicted, in particular a decrease of the wind speed in the Mediterranean area. Sources of those changes are investigated by quantifying the effects of changes in the weather type occurrences, and modifications of the distribution of the days within the weather types.",

While a broad variety of maize simulation models exist, it is not known whether different models diverge on grain yield responses to changes in climatic factors, or whether they agree in their general trends related to phenology, growth, and yield. With the goal of analyzing the sensitivity of simulated yields to changes in temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations CO2, we present the largest maize crop model intercomparison to date, including 23 different models. These models were evaluated for four locations representing a wide range of maize production conditions in the world: Lusignan (France), Ames (USA), Rio Verde (Brazil) and Morogoro (Tanzania). While individual models differed considerably in absolute yield simulation at the four sites, an ensemble of a minimum number of models was able to simulate absolute yields accurately at the four sites even with low data for calibration, thus suggesting that using an ensemble of models has merit. Temperature increase had strong negative influence on modeled yield response of roughly â0.5Â MgÂ haâ1 perÂ Â°C. Doubling CO2 from 360 to 720Â Î¼molÂ molâ1 increased grain yield by 7.5\\% on average across models and the sites. That would therefore make temperature the main factor altering maize yields at the end of this century. Furthermore, there was a large uncertainty in the yield response to CO2 among models. Model responses to temperature and CO2 did not differ whether models were simulated with low calibration information or, simulated with high level of calibration information.",

         "volume": "20","number": "7","abstract": "Potential consequences of climate change on crop production can be studied using mechanistic crop simulation models. While a broad variety of maize simulation models exist, it is not known whether different models diverge on grain yield responses to changes in climatic factors, or whether they agree in their general trends related to phenology, growth, and yield. With the goal of analyzing the sensitivity of simulated yields to changes in temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations CO2, we present the largest maize crop model intercomparison to date, including 23 different models. These models were evaluated for four locations representing a wide range of maize production conditions in the world: Lusignan (France), Ames (USA), Rio Verde (Brazil) and Morogoro (Tanzania). While individual models differed considerably in absolute yield simulation at the four sites, an ensemble of a minimum number of models was able to simulate absolute yields accurately at the four sites even with low data for calibration, thus suggesting that using an ensemble of models has merit. Temperature increase had strong negative influence on modeled yield response of roughly -0.5 Mg ha(-1) per degrees C. Doubling CO2 from 360 to 720 mu mol mol(-1) increased grain yield by 7.5\\% on average across models and the sites. That would therefore make temperature the main factor altering maize yields at the end of this century. Furthermore, there was a large uncertainty in the yield response to CO2 among models. Model responses to temperature and CO2 did not differ whether models were simulated with low calibration information or, simulated with high level of calibration information.",

Die Projektionen decken das Gebiet Deutschlands, Ãsterreichs und der Schweiz in einer hohen rÃ¤umlichen AuflÃ¶sung ab. Die Ergebnisse lassen sich auf folgende Aussagen verdichten: Je nach angenommenem Anstieg der Treibhausgaskonzentrationen kÃ¶nnten bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts die Temperaturen in Deutschland --- vor allem im SÃ¼den und SÃ¼dosten --- um mehr als 4 Â°C steigen. Im Sommer kann es in weiten Teilen Deutschlands weniger NiederschlÃ¤ge geben. Im Winter kÃ¶nnten im SÃ¼den und SÃ¼dosten mehr NiederschlÃ¤ge fallen, wobei allerdings wegen der gestiegenen Temperaturen weniger Schnee fallen kann. Das Umweltbundesamt hat erste Ergebnisse bereits im Jahre 2006 vorgestellt. Nun liegt der Abschlussbericht des Vorhabens vor.",

However, interpreting climate change projections to better understand the potential impacts of a changing climate on food security outcomes is challenging. This paper addresses this challenge through presenting a framework that enables rapid country-level assessment of vulnerability to food insecurity under a range of climate change and adaptation investment scenarios. The results show that vulnerability to food insecurity is projected to increase under all emissions scenarios, and the geographic distribution of vulnerability is similar to that of the present-day; parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are most severely affected. High levels of adaptation act to off-set these increases; however, only the scenario with the highest level of mitigation combined with high levels of adaptation shows improvements in vulnerability compared to the present-day. The results highlight the dual requirement for mitigation and adaptation to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and to make gains in tackling food insecurity. The approach is an update to the existing Hunger and Climate Vulnerability Index methodology to enable future projections, and the framework presented allows rapid updates to the results as and when new information becomes available, such as updated country-level yield data or climate model output. This approach provides a framework for assessing policy-relevant human food security outcomes for use in long-term climate change and food security planning; the results have been made available on an interactive website for policymakers (www.metoffice.gov.uk/food-insecurity-index).",

The model was tested across two studies with 439 post-secondary students from Canada, the United States, and Germany for Study 1, and 56 students from Canada for Study 2. For Study 1, students self-reported their epistemic beliefs about climate change, read four conflicting documents about the causes and consequences of climate change, self-reported their epistemic emotions and learning strategies used to learn the content, and were given an inference verification test to measure learning. Study 2 used the same procedure but added a think aloud protocol to capture self-regulatory processes and emotions as they occurred. Path analyses revealed that epistemic beliefs served as important antecedents to the epistemic emotions students experienced during learning. Students who believed that the justification of knowledge about climate change requires critical evaluation of multiple sources experienced higher levels of enjoyment and curiosity, and lower levels of boredom when confronted with conflicting information. A belief in the complexity of this knowledge was related to lower levels of confusion, anxiety, and boredom. A belief in the uncertainty of this knowledge predicted lower levels of anxiety and frustration, and a belief in the active construction of knowledge predicted lower levels of confusion. Epistemic emotions predicted the types of learning strategies students used to learn the content and mediated relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies. Learning strategies predicted learning outcomes and mediated relations between epistemic emotions and learning outcomes. Implications for research on epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, and students' self-regulated learning are discussed.",

Jet stream changes are analyzed both using a direct measure of the near-surface westerly wind maximum and using an EOF-based approach. This allows jet stream changes to be related to the widely used leading patterns of variability: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic (EA) pattern. Viewed in NAO?EA state space, isolines of jet latitude and speed resemble a distorted polar coordinate system, highlighting the dependence of the jet stream quantities on both spatial patterns. Some differences in the results of the two methods are discussed, but both approaches agree on the general characteristics of the climate models. While there is some agreement between models on a poleward shift of the jet stream in response to anthropogenic forcing, there is still considerable spread between different model projections, especially in winter. Furthermore, the model responses to forcing are often weaker than their biases when compared to a reanalysis. Diagnoses of jet stream changes can be sensitive to the methodologies used, and several aspects of this are also discussed.",

It provides a quantitative/qualitative analysis of vegetation-environment relationships for four summits along an altitude gradient on the Lefka Ori massif Crete (1664Ã¢\u0080\u00932339&nbsp;m). The GLORIA multi-summit approach was used to provide vegetation and floristic data together with temperature records for every summit. Species richness and species turnover was calculated together with floristic similarity between the summits. 70 species were recorded, 20 of which were endemic, belonging to 23 different families. Cretan endemics dominate at these high altitudes. Species richness and turnover decreased with altitude. The two highest summits showed greater floristic similarity. Only 20% of the total flora recorded reaches the highest summit while 10% is common among summits. Overall there was a 4.96C decrease in temperature along the 675&nbsp;m gradient. Given a scenario of temperature increase the ecotone between the sub-alpine and alpine zone would be likely to have the greatest species turnover. Southern exposures are likely to be invaded first by thermophilous species while northern exposures are likely to be more resistant to changes. Species distribution shifts will also depend on habitat availability. Many, already threatened, local endemic species will be affected first.",

Range shifts are a key response, but in many cases are incompatible with the current extent of protected areas. In this study we used ensemble species distribution models to identify range changes for 21 reptile and 16 amphibian species in Romania for the 2020s and 2050s time horizons under three emission scenarios (A1B = integrated world, rapid economic growth, A2A = divided world, rapid economic growth realistic scenario, B2A = regional development, environmentally-friendly scenario) and no- and limited-dispersal assumptions. We then used irreplaceability analysis to test the efficacy of the Natura 2000 network to meet conservation targets. Under all scenarios and time horizons, 90\\% of the species suffered range contractions (greatest loses under scenarios B2A for 2020s, and A1B for 2050s), and four reptile species expanded their ranges. Two reptile and two amphibian species are predicted to completely lose climate space by 2050s. Currently, 35 species do not meet conservation targets (\\textgreater40\\% representation in protected areas), but the target is predicted to be met for 4 - 14 species under future climate conditions, with higher representation under the limited-dispersal scenario. The Alpine and Steppic-Black Sea biogeographic regions have the highest irreplaceability value, and act as climate refugia for many reptiles and amphibians. The Natura 2000 network performs better for achieving herpetofauna conservation goals in the future, owing to the interaction between drastic range contractions, and range shifts towards existing protected areas. Thus, conservation actions for herpetofauna in Romania need to focus on: (1) building institutional capacity of protected areas in the Alpine and Steppic-Black Sea biogeographic regions, and (2) facilitating natural range shifts by improving the conservation status of herpetofauna outside protected areas, specifically in traditionally-managed landscapes and abandoned cropland.",

But to do this requires us to break from the failed reliance on the market and instead to invest in a huge expansion of public sector jobs across all sectors from transport, energy and food to homes, education and more, which are essential to tackling the climate crisis. At the heart of this, we argue, needs to be a National Climate Service which can organise, plan, train workers and deliver the jobs so urgently needed. The changes needed are ones which will improve our lives, ensuring among other things we have warm homes, a fully integrated public transport system and most importantly a safe climate and ecology now and in the future.",

Range shifts are a key response, but in many cases are incompatible with the current extent of protected areas. In this study we used ensemble species distribution models to identify range changes for 21 reptile and 16 amphibian species in Romania for the 2020s and 2050s time horizons under three emission scenarios (A1B = integrated world, rapid economic growth, A2A = divided world, rapid economic growth realistic scenario, B2A = regional development, environmentally-friendly scenario) and no- and limited-dispersal assumptions. We then used irreplaceability analysis to test the efficacy of the Natura 2000 network to meet conservation targets. Under all scenarios and time horizons, 90% of the species suffered range contractions (greatest loses under scenarios B2A for 2020s, and A1B for 2050s), and four reptile species expanded their ranges. Two reptile and two amphibian species are predicted to completely lose climate space by 2050s. Currently, 35 species do not meet conservation targets (>40% representation in protected areas), but the target is predicted to be met for 4 - 14 species under future climate conditions, with higher representation under the limited-dispersal scenario. The Alpine and Steppic-Black Sea biogeographic regions have the highest irreplaceability value, and act as climate refugia for many reptiles and amphibians. The Natura 2000 network performs better for achieving herpetofauna conservation goals in the future, owing to the interaction between drastic range contractions, and range shifts towards existing protected areas. Thus, conservation actions for herpetofauna in Romania need to focus on: (1) building institutional capacity of protected areas in the Alpine and Steppic-Black Sea biogeographic regions, and (2) facilitating natural range shifts by improving the conservation status of herpetofauna outside protected areas, specifically in traditionally-managed landscapes and abandoned cropland.",

Measurements made from 1965 to 1998 in Barbados trade winds show large interannual changes that are highly anticorrelated with rainfall in the Soudano-Sahel, a region that has suffered varying degrees of drought since 1970. Regression estimates based on long-term rainfall data suggest that dust concentrations were sharply lower during much of the 20th century before 1970, when rainfall was more normal. Because of the great sensitivity of dust emissions to climate, future changes in climate could result in large changes in emissions from African and other arid regions that, in turn, could lead to impacts on climate over large areas.",

In this paper we consider the more complicated but more likely possibility that human activities themselves can interact with climate or environmental change in ways that either mitigate or exacerbate the human impacts. Although human activities in the Arctic are generally assumed to be modest, our analysis suggests that those activities may have larger influences on the arctic system than previously thought. Moreover, human influences could increase substantially in the near future. First, we illustrate how past human activities in the Arctic have combined with climatic variations to alter biophysical systems upon which fisheries and livestock depend. Second, we describe how current and future human activities could precipitate or affect the timing of major transitions in the arctic system. Past and future analyses both point to ways in which human activities in the Arctic can substantially influence the trajectory of arctic system change.",

It is shown that the one-month lead seasonal forecast skill of the six models' multi-model ensemble is significantly increased from P1 to P2 for all four seasons. We identify four possible reasons accounting for the interdecadal change of the seasonal forecast skill. Firstly, the numerical model's ability to simulate the mean state, the time variability and the spatial structures of the sea surface temperature and precipitation over the tropical Pacific is improved in P2 compared to P1. Secondly, an examination of the potential predictability of the atmosphere, estimated by the ratio of the total variance to the variance due to the internal dynamics of the model atmosphere, reveals that the atmospheric potential predictability is significantly increased after 1980s which is mainly due to an increased influence of El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation signal over the North Pacific and North American regions. Thirdly, the long-term climate trends in the atmosphere are found to contribute, to some extent, to the increased seasonal forecast skill especially over the Eurasian regions. Finally, the improved ocean observations in P2 may provide better initial conditions for the coupled models' seasonal forecast.",

The large size of the data set gives the opportunity to detect the changes of climate extremes and means with high statistical confidence. Daily precipitation data are used to calculate the seasonal precipitation maximum and the seasonal mean. Modeled precipitation data appear consistent with observation-based data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project. The data are split into six time periods of 25 years to get independent time series. The seasonal peaks are modeled by using the generalized extreme value distribution, while empirical distributions are used to study changes of the seasonal precipitation mean. Finally, we use an empirical method to detect changes of occurrence of very wet and dry periods. Results from these model simulations indicate that over most of the world precipitation maxima will increase in the future. Seasonal means behave differently. In many regions they are decreasing or not increasing. The occurrence of very wet periods is strongly increasing during boreal winter in the extratropics and decreasing in the tropics. In summary, wet regions become wetter and dry regions become drier.",

The physiological consequence of formation of ice crystals in plant tissue is often death of the plants, or at least of sensitive parts that can include flower buds, ovaries, and leaves. The loss of potential for sexual reproduction can have long-lasting effects on the demography of annuals and long-lived perennials, because the short-term negative effects of frosts can result in longer-term benefits through lowered populations of seed predators. The loss of host plants can have dramatic consequences for herbivores, even causing local extinctions, and the loss of just flowers can also affect populations of seed predators and their parasitoids. Frosts can cause local extinctions and influence the geographical distribution of some species. The potential for global climate change to influence the frequency and distribution of frost events is uncertain, but it seems likely that they may become more frequent in some areas and less frequent in others.",

         "pages": "1--13","abstract": "China has a large economic and demographic exposure to extreme events that is increasing rapidly due to its fast development, and climate change may further aggravate the situation. This paper investigates China's socioeconomic risk from extreme events under climate change over the next few decades with a focus on sub-national heterogeneity. The empirical relationships between socioeconomic damages and their determinants are identified using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, and are used to estimate future damages as well as associated uncertainty bounds given specified climate and development scenarios. Considering projected changes in exposure, we find that the southwest and central regions and Hainan Island of China are likely to have a larger percentage of population at risk, while most of the southwest and central regions could generally have higher economic losses. Finally, the analysis suggests that increasing income can significantly decrease the number of people affected by extremes.",

We achieve this by homogenizing the Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 2c-based GBI and splicing it with the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis-based GBI. For the whole time period, there are significant decreases in GBI in autumn, October and November, and no significant monthly, seasonal or annual increases. More recently, since 1981 there are significant GBI increases in all seasons and annually, with the strongest monthly increases in July and August. A recent clustering of high GBI values is evident in summer, when 7 of the top 11 values in the last 165 years \u2013 including the two latest years 2014 and 2015 \u2013 occurred since 2007. Also, 2010 is the highest GBI year in the annual, spring, winter and December series but 2011 is the record low GBI value in the spring and April series. Moreover, since 1851 there have been significant increases in GBI variability in May and especially December. December has also shown a significant clustering of extreme high and low GBI values since 2001, mirroring a similar, recently identified phenomenon in the December North Atlantic Oscillation index, suggesting a related driving mechanism. We discuss changes in hemispheric circulation that are associated with high compared with low GBI conditions. Our GBI time series should be useful for climatologists and other scientists interested in aspects and impacts of Arctic variability and change.",

Societies have recognized that anthropogenic CO2 emissions must be reduced and ultimately cease to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts.  However, at present timely and necessary emissions reductions appear to be very difficult to achieve. To compliment less than sufficient emissions reductions carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is suggested. CDR is proposed through increasing natural carbon sinks, engineering new carbon sinks, or combing natural uptake with engineered storage. Initial studies demonstrate that removal of CO2 from the atmosphere will elicit a carbon cycle response with a \u201Crebound\u201D and other feedbacks generally opposing and so reducing the net-removal.  We review this work into the carbon cycle response to CDR in general and for different proposed CDR methods and discuss future research needs.  Understanding these dynamics and their uncertainties have important implications for quantifying the efficacy of CDR.",

         "abstract": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is an active component of the Earth\u2019s climate system1 and its response to global warming is of critical importance to society. Climate models have shown an AMOC slowdown under anthropogenic warming since the industrial revolution2\u20134, but this slowdown has been difficult to detect in the short observational record5\u201310 because of substantial interdecadal climate variability. This has led to the indirect detection of the slowdown from longer-term fingerprints11\u201314 such as the subpolar North Atlantic \u2018warming hole\u201911. However, these fingerprints, which exhibit some uncertainties15, are all local indicators of AMOC slowdown around the subpolar North Atlantic. Here we show observational and modelling evidence of a remote indicator of AMOC slowdown outside the North Atlantic. Under global warming, the weakening AMOC reduces the salinity divergence and then leads to a \u2018salinity pile-up\u2019 remotely in the South Atlantic. This evidence is consistent with the AMOC slowdown under anthropogenic warming and, furthermore, suggests that this weakening has likely occurred all the way into the South Atlantic.",

         "abstract": "While the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is expected to weaken under increasing GHGs, it is unclear how it would respond to stabilization of global warming of 1.5 or 2.0\u2009Â°C, the Paris Agreement temperature targets, or 3.0\u2009Â°C, the expected warming by 2100 under current emission reduction policies. On the basis of stabilized warming simulations with two Earth System Models, we find that, after temperature stabilization, the AMOC declines for 5\u201310\u2009years followed by a 150-year recovery to a level that is approximately independent of the considered stabilization scenario. The AMOC recovery has important implications for North Atlantic steric sea-level rise, which by 2600 is simulated to be 25\u201331% less than the global mean, and for North Atlantic surface temperatures, which continue to increase despite global mean surface temperature stabilization. These results show that substantial ongoing climate trends are likely to occur after global mean temperature has stabilized.",

From a scientific perspective, the question can be framed in various ways, and the answer depends very much on the framing. One such framing is a risk-based approach, which answers the question probabilistically, in terms of a change in likelihood of a class of event similar to the one in question, and natural variability is treated as noise. A rather different framing is a storyline approach, which examines the role of the various factors contributing to the event as it unfolded, including the anomalous aspects of natural variability, and answers the question deterministically. It is argued that these two apparently irreconcilable approaches can be viewed within a common framework, where the most useful level of conditioning will depend on the question being asked and the uncertainties involved.",

         "volume": "115","number": "D10","pages": "D10101+","abstract": "A new quantile-based mapping method is developed for the bias correction of monthly global circulation model outputs. Compared to the widely used quantile-based matching method that assumes stationarity and only uses the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the model and observations for the baseline period, the proposed method incorporates and adjusts the model CDF for the projection period on the basis of the difference between the model and observation CDFs for the training (baseline) period. Thus, the method explicitly accounts for distribution changes for a given model between the projection and baseline periods. We demonstrate the use of the new method over northern Eurasia. We fit a four-parameter beta distribution to monthly temperature fields and discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of distribution range parameters. For monthly precipitation data, a mixed gamma distribution is used that accounts for the intermittent nature of rainfall. To test the fidelity of the proposed method, we choose 1970\u20131999 as the baseline training period and then randomly select 30 years from 1901\u20131999 as the projection test period. The bootstrapping is repeated 30 times to mimic different climate conditions that may occur, and the results suggest that both methods are comparable when applied to the 20th century for both temperature and precipitation for the examined quartiles. We also discuss the dependence of the bias correction results on the choice of time period for training. This indicates that the remaining biases in the bias-corrected time series are directly tied to the model's performance during the training period, and therefore care should be taken when using a particular training time period. When applied to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report (AR4) A2 climate scenario projection, the data time series after bias correction from both methods exhibit similar spatial patterns. However, over regions where the climate model shows large changes in projected variability, there are discernable differences between the methods. The proposed method is more sensitive to a reduction in variability, exemplified by wintertime temperature. Further synthetic experiments using the lower 33\\% and upper 33\\% of the full data set as the validation data suggest that the proposed equidistance quantile-matching method is more efficient in reducing biases than the traditional CDF mapping method for changing climates, especially for the tails of the distribution. This has important consequences for the occurrence and intensity of future projected extreme events such as heat waves, floods, and droughts. As the new method is simple to implement and does not require substantial computational time, it can be used to produce auxiliary ensemble scenarios for various climate impact-oriented applications.",

A continuation of this intensification trend is projected by climate scenarios for the twenty-first century. The response of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean to changes in wind stress and surface buoyancy fluxes is under debate. Here we analyse the Argo network of profiling floats and historical oceanographic data to detect coherent hemispheric-scale warming and freshening trends that extend to depths of more than 1,000 m. The warming and freshening is partly related to changes in the properties of the water masses that make up the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which are consistent with the anthropogenic changes in heat and freshwater fluxes suggested by climate models. However, we detect no increase in the tilt of the surfaces of equal density across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, in contrast to coarse-resolution model studies. Our results imply that the transport in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and meridional overturning in the Southern Ocean are insensitive to decadal changes in wind stress.",

         "volume": "10","number": "1","pages": "597--624","abstract": "Potential evapotranspiration PET is the water that would be lost by plants through evaporation and transpiration if water was not limited in the soil, and it is commonly used in conceptual hydrological modelling in the calculation of runoff production and hence river discharge. Future changes of PET are likely to be as important as changes in precipitation patterns in determining changes in river flows. However PET is not calculated routinely by climate models so it must be derived independently when the impact of climate change on river flow is to be assessed. This paper compares PET estimates from twelve equations of different complexity, driven by the Hadley Centre's HadRM3-Q0 model outputs representative of 1961\u20131990, with MORECS PET, a product used as reference PET in Great Britain. The results show that the FAO56 version of the Penman-Monteith equations reproduce best the spatial and seasonal variability of MORECS PET across GB when driven by HadRM3-Q0 estimates of relative humidity, total cloud, wind speed and linearly bias-corrected mean surface temperature. This suggests that potential biases in HadRM3-Q0 climate do not result in significant biases when the physically-based FAO56 equations are used. Percentage changes in PET between the 1961\u20131990 and 2041\u20132070 time slices were also calculated for each of the twelve PET equations. Results show a large variation in the magnitude (and sometimes direction) of changes estimated from different PET equations, with Turc, Jensen-Hense and calibrated Blaney-Criddle methods systematically projecting the largest increases across GB for all months and Priestley-Taylor, Makkink and Thornthwaite showing the smallest changes. We recommend the use of the FAO56 equation as when driven by HadRM3-Q0 climate data this best reproduces the reference MORECS PET across Great Britain for the reference period of 1961\u20131990. Further, the future changes of PET estimated by FAO56 are within the range of uncertainty defined by the ensemble of twelve PET equations. The changes show a clear northwest-southeast gradient of PET increase with largest (smallest) changes in the northwest in January (July and October) respectively. However, the range in magnitude of PET changes due to the choice of PET method shown in this study for Great Britain suggests that PET uncetainty is perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing the assessment of climate change impact on hydrology.",

While converting wind's kinetic energy into electricity, wind turbines modify surface\u2013atmosphere exchanges and the transfer of energy, momentum, mass and moisture within the atmosphere4, 5, 6. These changes, if spatially large enough, may have noticeable impacts on local to regional weather and climate. Here we present observational evidence for such impacts based on analyses of satellite data for the period of 2003\u20132011 over a region in west-central Texas, where four of the world's largest wind farms are located7. Our results show a significant warming trend of up to 0.72\u2009Â°C per decade, particularly at night-time, over wind farms relative to nearby non-wind-farm regions. We attribute this warming primarily to wind farms as its spatial pattern and magnitude couples very well with the geographic distribution of wind turbines.",

However, since 1998, six strains of bluetongue virus have spread across 12 countries and 800 km further north in Europe than has previously been reported. We suggest that this spread has been driven by recent changes in European climate that have allowed increased virus persistence during winter, the northward expansion of Culicoides imicola, the main bluetongue virus vector, and, beyond this vector's range, transmission by indigenous European Culicoides species - thereby expanding the risk of transmission over larger geographical regions. Understanding this sequence of events may help us predict the emergence of other vector-borne pathogens.",

We present longitudinal studies of 23 extant mammal species, modelling ecological niches and predicting geographical distributions reciprocally between the Last Glacial Maximum and present to test this evolutionary conservatism. This study covered distributional shifts in mammal species across the lower 48 states of the United States. We used a machine-learning tool for modelling species' ecological niches, based on known occurrences and electronic maps summarizing ecological dimensions, to assess the ability of ecological niches as modelled in one time period to predict the geographical distribution of the species in another period, and vice versa. High intertemporal predictivity between niche models and species' occurrences indicate that niche conservatism is widespread among the taxa studied, particularly when statistical power is considered as a reason for failure of reciprocal predictions. Niche projections to the present for 8 mammal taxa that became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene generally increased in area, and thus do not support the hypothesis of niche collapse as a major driving force in their extinction. Ecological niches represent long-term stable constraints on the distributional potential of species; indeed, this study suggests that mammal species have tracked consistent climate profiles throughout the drastic climate change events that marked the end of the Pleistocene glaciations. Many current modelling efforts focusing on anticipating climate change effects on species' potential geographical distributions will be bolstered by this result 2014 in essence, the first longitudinal demonstration of niche conservatism.",

         "abstract": "The impact of climate change on annual air temperature and precipitation has received a great deal of attention by scholars worldwide. Many studies have been conducted to illustrate that changes in annual temperature and precipitation are becoming evident on a global scale. This study focuses on detecting trends in annual temperature and precipitation for the nine states in the Northeastern United States. For this study, the widely used modified Mann-Kendall test was run at 5\\% significance level on time series data for each of the nine states for the time period, 1900 to 2011. The resultant Mann- Kendall test statistic (S) indicates how strong the trend in temperature and precipitation is and whether it is increasing or decreasing. For temperature, all the states indicate statistically significant increasing trends, except for Pennsylvania and Maine that do not indicate statistically significant trends. In the case of precipitation, the states of New Hampshire and Maine do not show statistically significant results, while the other states show statistically significant increasing trends. On the contrary, linear trend line plotting indicates increasing trend in temperature for all nine northeastern states in the range of 0.00006 to 0.02 Â°F/yr, while a US EPA study demonstrates that the US average temperature rise is 1.3Â°F/century. 1 For precipitation, the linear trend line indicates a decreasing trend for Maine, while the other eight states have an increasing trend that ranges from 0.03 to 0.13 mm/yr.",

The first part of the issue comprises seven overarching PRUDENCE papers\non: \n(1) the design of the model simulations and analyses of climate model performance,\n(2 and 3) evaluation and intercomparison of simulated climate changes, \n(4 and 5) specialised analyses of impacts on water resources and on other sectors including agriculture, ecosystems, energy, and transport, \n(6) investigation of extreme weather events and \n(7) implications of the results for policy. A paper summarising the related MICE (Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes) project is also included. The second part of the issue contains 12 articles that focus in more detail on some of the themes summarised in the overarching papers.\nThe PRUDENCE results represent the first comprehensive, continental-scale intercomparison and evaluation of high resolution climate models and their applications, bringing together climate modelling, impact research and social sciences expertise on climate change.",

The demand for understanding the value and benefits of using SCF in decision\u2010making processes can be associated with different logics. Two of these would be the need to justify public and private investment in the provision of SCF and demonstrating the gains and benefits of using SCF in specific decision\u2010making contexts. This paper reviews the main factors influencing how SCF is (or can be) valued in supporting decision\u2010making and the main methods and metrics currently used to perform such valuations. Our review results in four key findings: (a) there is a current emphasis on economic ex ante studies and the quantification of SCF value; (b) there are fundamental differences in how the value of SCF is defined and estimated across methods and approaches; (c) most valuation methods are unable to capture the differential benefits and risks of using SCF across spatiotemporal scales and groups; and (d) there is limited involvement of the decision\u2010makers in the valuation process. The paper concludes by providing some guiding principles towards more effective valuations of SCF, notably the need for a wider diversity and integration of methodological approaches. These should particularly embrace ex\u2010post, qualitative, and participatory approaches which allow co\u2010evaluation with decision\u2010makers so that more comprehensive and equitable SCF valuations can be developed in future.",

Data from ecosystem-scale Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments provide a unique opportunity to reduce this uncertainty. The recent FACE Model\u2013Data Synthesis project aimed to use the information gathered in two forest FACE experiments to assess and improve land ecosystem models. A new 'assumption-centred' model intercomparison approach was used, in which participating models were evaluated against experimental data based on the ways in which they represent key ecological processes. By identifying and evaluating the main assumptions causing differences among models, the assumption-centred approach produced a clear roadmap for reducing model uncertainty. Here, we explain this approach and summarize the resulting research agenda. We encourage the application of this approach in other model intercomparison projects to fundamentally improve predictive understanding of the Earth system.",

This is based on a set of ensemble simulations of equilibrium and time-dependent changes, carried out by perturbing poorly constrained parameters controlling key physical and biogeochemical processes in the HadCM3 coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere global climate model. These (ongoing) experiments allow quantification of the effects of earth system modelling uncertainties and internal climate variability on feedbacks likely to exert a significant influence on twenty-first century climate at large regional scales. A further ensemble of regional climate simulations at 25\u200Akm resolution is being produced for Europe, allowing the specification of probabilistic predictions at spatial scales required for studies of climate impacts. The ensemble simulations are processed using a set of statistical procedures, the centrepiece of which is a Bayesian statistical framework designed for use with complex but imperfect models. This supports the generation of probabilities constrained by a wide range of observational metrics, and also by expert-specified prior distributions defining the model parameter space. The Bayesian framework also accounts for additional uncertainty introduced by structural modelling errors, which are estimated using our ensembles to predict the results of alternative climate models containing different structural assumptions. This facilitates the generation of probabilistic predictions combining information from perturbed physics and multi-model ensemble simulations. The methodology makes extensive use of emulation and scaling techniques trained on climate model results. These are used to sample the equilibrium response to doubled carbon dioxide at any required point in the parameter space of surface and atmospheric processes, to sample time-dependent changes by combining this information with ensembles sampling uncertainties in the transient response of a wider set of earth system processes, and to sample changes at local scales.",

Thus, the Earth system consequences of solar geoengineering are central to understanding its potentials and risks. Here we review the state-of-the-art knowledge about stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection and an idealized proxy for this, \u2018sunshade geoengineering,\u2019 in which the intensity of incoming sunlight is directly reduced in models. Studies are consistent in suggesting that sunshade geoengineering and stratospheric aerosol injection would generally offset the climate effects of elevated GHG concentrations. However, it is clear that a solar geoengineered climate would be novel in some respects, one example being a notably reduced hydrological cycle intensity. Moreover, we provide an overview of nonclimatic aspects of the response to stratospheric aerosol injection, for example, its effect on ozone, and the uncertainties around its consequences. We also consider the issues raised by the partial control over the climate that solar geoengineering would allow. Finally, this overview highlights some key research gaps in need of being resolved to provide sound basis for guidance of future decisions around solar geoengineering.

Changes in the frequency and duration of these circulation types, driven by the simulations following a moderate transient pathway of anthropogenic emissions, are then shown for the period 2070 to 2100. Increases in the future probability of hot days are then attributed separately to changes in the frequency and temperature intensity of the circulation types. Changes in temperature intensity are found to have an effect 2 to 3 times larger than in frequency.The authors then consider how model uncertainty in changes of future temperature within circulation patterns compares to the uncertainty irrespective of circulation, in an attempt to exclude contributions to the overall uncertainty arising from changes in circulation. Within individual patterns, the range of meteorological physical processes may be narrower. However, no reduction in uncertainty was found when single patterns were considered. Contributions to the lack of narrowing from circulation-type duration, model vegetation root depth and changes in cloud cover, pressure gradient, and continental-scale warming are subsequently examined using relationships between changes in surface latent heat and temperature. Vegetation root depth is found to be the greatest contributor to the temperature uncertainty.",

The survey considered two locations: Abadigba and Apata-Okene, as well as three sowing periods: March/April, April/May and June/July, while 10 farms were sampled /sowing period. Surveys of 60 (30 farms/location) purposely selected farms measuring at least an acre were conducted to ascertain the prevalence of stem borer incidences among sampled maize farms. A total of 240 quadrate throws (75Ã75cm) were randomly conducted at an average of 4 quadrate throws per maize field and investigated for stem borer infestation then tagged for subsequent data collection. Data were collected by either manual counting of affected plants and recorded as percentage of plants in the sampled quadrates, or by visual assessment as it affects levels of leaf damage resulting from stem borer activities. Data collected include: number of infested maize stands per quadrate throws expressed in percentage; assessment of the levels of leaf damage; and cobs yield per maize stand. Results obtained from the farm surveys were subjected to the percentile method of presentation. The results reveal varying degrees of stem borer infestation and crop damage; percentage infestation varies with planting date, as well as location, with crops sown between March and April suffering the highest infestation, while those sown between June and July gave the least pest infestation in both locations.",

A warmer climate will lead to a longer pollen season and more days with high pollen counts. In addition, a warmer climate increases the risk of proliferation of new plants with well-known allergenic pollens like ragweed, plane tree and wall pellitory, which have not previously caused allergy in Denmark. The consequences will be more people with hay fever and pollen asthma, longer allergy seasons and an increase in the severity of symptoms, disease-related costs and demands on health care for diagnosis and treatment of more complex allergies.",

Here we explore the political dimensions and policy implications of expectations for \u201Cnegative emissions\u201D in the European Union (EU), considering its largely successful leadership role in mitigation action and corresponding low-carbon technology development and deployment. Carbon dioxide removal and especially Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage present significant challenges to the EU's dominant climate policy paradigm and low-carbon policy experience. Considering this challenge, we assess expectations for widespread implementation of carbon dioxide removal in the EU to be unrealistic, and explore possible pathways for its more limited introduction.

While Europe will warm overall in the future, we find that episodes of cold months will continue to occur and there remains substantial probability for the occurrence of cold winters in Europe linked with sea ice reduction in the Barents and Kara Sea sector. A pattern of cold-European warm-Arctic anomaly is typical for the cold events in the future, which is associated with the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation. These patterns, however, differ from the corresponding patterns in the historical period, and underline the connection between European cold winter events and Arctic sea ice reduction.",

         "abstract": "Winter extreme weather events receive major public attention due to their serious impacts1, but the dominant factors regulating their interdecadal trends have not been clearly established2,3. Here, we show that the radiative forcing due to geospatially redistributed anthropogenic aerosols mainly determined the spatial variations of winter extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere during 1970\u20132005, a unique transition period for global aerosol forcing4. Over this period, the local Rossby wave activity and extreme events (top 10% in wave amplitude) exhibited marked declining trends at high latitudes, mainly in northern Eurasia. The combination of long-term observational data and a state-of-the-art climate model revealed the unambiguous signature of anthropogenic aerosols on the wintertime jet stream, planetary wave activity and surface temperature variability on interdecadal timescales. In particular, warming due to aerosol reductions in Europe enhanced the meridional temperature gradient on the jet\u2019s poleward flank and strengthened the zonal wind, resulting in significant suppression in extreme events over northern Eurasia. These results exemplify how aerosol forcing can impact large-scale extratropical atmospheric dynamics, and illustrate the importance of anthropogenic aerosols and their spatiotemporal variability in assessing the drivers of extreme weather in historical and future climate.",

The absence of realistic variability in the Sahel in most 20th-century simulations casts some doubt on the reliability of coupled models in this region. Vegetation feedbacks and feedbacks from dust aerosol production are not included in the global models. Possible future land surface modification is also not taken into account in the projections. The extent to which current regional models can successfully downscale precipitation over Africa is unclear, and limitations of empirical downscaling results for Africa are not fully understood.\"\n\n11.2.1 The factors that determine the southern boundary of the Sahara and rainfall in the Sahel have attracted special interest because of the extended drought experienced by this region in the 1970s and 1980s. The field has moved steadily away from explanations for rainfall variations in this region as primarily due to land use changes and towards explanations based on changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The early SST perturbation Atmospheric GCM (AGCM) experiments (Palmer, 1986; Rowell, et al., 1995) are reinforced by the results from the most recent models (Giannini et al., 2003; Lu and Delworth, 2005; Hoerling et al., 2006). The north-south inter-hemispheric gradient, with colder NH oceans conducive to an equatorward shift and/or a reduction in Sahel rainfall, is important. This has created interest in the possibility that aerosol cooling localised in the NH could dry the Sahel (Rotstayn and Lohmann, 2002; see also Section 9.5.4.3.1). However, temperatures over other oceanic regions, including the Mediterranean (Rowell, 2003), are also important.\"\n\n 9.5.4.3.1 Sahel drought\n\"Rainfall decreased substantially across the Sahel from the 1950s until at least the late 1980s (Dai et al., 2004; Figure 9.19, see also Figure 3.37). There has been a partial recovery since about 1990, although rainfall has not returned to levels typical of the period 1920 to 1965. Zeng (2003) note that two main hypotheses have been proposed as a cause of the extended drought: overgrazing and conversion of woodland to agriculture increasing surface albedo and reducing moisture supply to the atmosphere, and large-scale atmospheric circulation changes related to decadal global SST changes that could be of anthropogenic or natural origin (Nicholson, 2001). Black carbon has also been suggested as a contributor (Menon et al., 2002b). Taylor et al. (2002) examine the impact of land use change with an atmospheric GCM forced only by estimates of Sahelian land use change since 1961. They simulate a small decrease in Sahel rainfall (around 5\\% by 1996) and conclude that the impacts of recent land use changes are not large enough to have been the principal cause of the drought.\n\nFigure 9.19\n\nFigure 9.19. Observed (Climatic Research Unit TS 2.1; Mitchell and Jones, 2005) Sahel July to September rainfall for each year (black), compared to an ensemble mean of 10 simulations of the atmospheric/land component of the GFDL-CM2.0 model (see Table 8.1 for model details) forced with observed SSTs (red). Both model and observations are normalized to unit mean over 1950-2000. The grey band represents Â±1 standard deviation of intra-ensemble variability. After Held et al. (2005), based on results in Lu and Delworth (2005).\n\nSeveral recent studies have demonstrated that simulations with a range of atmospheric models using prescribed observed SSTs are able to reproduce observed decadal variations in Sahel rainfall (Bader and Latif, 2003; Giannini et al., 2003; Rowell, 2003; Haarsma et al., 2005; Held et al., 2005; Lu and Delworth, 2005; see also Figure 9.19; Hoerling et al., 2006), consistent with earlier findings (Folland, 1986; Rowell, 1996). Hoerling et al. (2006) show that AGCMs with observed SST changes typically underestimate the magnitude of the observed precipitation changes, although the models and observations are not inconsistent. These studies differ somewhat in terms of which ocean SSTs they find to be most important: Giannini et al. (2003) and Bader and Latif (2003) emphasize the role of tropical Indian Ocean warming, Hoerling et al. (2006) attribute the drying trend to a progressive warming of the South Atlantic relative to the North Atlantic, and Rowell (2003) finds that Mediterranean SSTs are an additional important contributor to decadal variations in Sahel rainfall. Based on a multi-model ensemble of coupled model simulations Hoerling et al. (2006) conclude that the observed drying trend in the Sahel is not consistent with simulated internal variability alone.\n\nThus, recent research indicates that changes in SSTs are probably the dominant influence on rainfall in the Sahel, although land use changes possibly also contribute (Taylor et al., 2002). But what has caused the differential SST changes? Rotstayn and Lohmann (2002) propose that spatially varying, anthropogenic sulphate aerosol forcing (both direct and indirect) can alter low-latitude atmospheric circulation leading to a decline in Sahel rainfall. They find a southward shift of tropical rainfall due to a hemispheric asymmetry in the SST response to changes in cloud albedo and lifetime in a climate simulation forced with recent anthropogenic changes in sulphate aerosol. Williams et al. (2001) also find a southward shift of tropical rainfall as a response to the indirect effect of sulphate aerosol. These results suggest that sulphate aerosol changes may have led to reduced warming of the northern tropical oceans, which in turn led to the decrease in Sahel rainfall, possibly enhanced through land-atmosphere interaction, although a full attribution analysis has yet to be conducted. Held et al. (2005) show that historical climate simulations with the both the GFDL-CM2.0 and CM2.1 models (see Table 8.1 for details) exhibit drying trends over the Sahel in the second half of the 20th century, which they ascribe to a combination of greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol changes. The spatial pattern of the trends in simulated rainfall also shows some agreement with observations. However, Hoerling et al. (2006) find that eight other coupled climate models with prescribed anthropogenic forcing do not simulate significant trends in Sahel rainfall over the 1950 to 1999 period. \"\n\n11.2.2:\"The ITCZ in the Atlantic is displaced equatorward in nearly all of these AOGCM simulations. Ocean temperatures are too warm by an average of 1Â°C to 2Â°C in the Gulf of Guinea and typically by 3Â°C off the southwest coast in the region of intense upwelling, which is clearly too weak in many models. In several of the models there is no West African monsoon as the summer rains fail to move from the Gulf onto land, but most of the models do have a monsoonal climate albeit with some distortion. Moderately realistic interannual variability of SSTs in the Gulf of Guinea and the associated dipolar rainfall variations in the Sahel and the Guinean Coast are, by the criteria of Cook and Vizy (2006), only present in 4 of the 18 models examined. Tennant (2003) describes biases in several AGCMs, such as the equatorward displacement of the mid-latitude jet in austral summer, a deficiency that persists in the most recent simulations (Chapter 8).\n\nDespite these deficiencies, AGCMs can simulate the basic pattern of rainfall trends in the second half of the 20th century if given the observed SST evolution as boundary conditions, as described in the multi-model analysis of Hoerling et al. (2006) and the growing literature on the interannual variability and trends in individual models (e.g., Rowell et al., 1995; Bader and Latif, 2003; Giannini et al., 2003; Haarsma et al., 2005; Kamga et al., 2005; Lu and Delworth, 2005). However, there is less confidence in the ability of AOGCMs to generate interannual variability in the SSTs of the type known to affect African rainfall, as evidenced by the fact that very few AOGCMs produce droughts comparable in magnitude to the Sahel drought of the 1970s and 1980s (Hoerling et al., 2006). There are exceptions, but what distinguishes these from the bulk of the models is not understood.\n\nThe very wet Sahara 6 to 8 ka is thought to have been a response to the increased summer insolation due to changes in the Earth's orbital configuration. Modelling studies of this response provide background information on the quality of a model's African monsoon, but the processes controlling the response to changing seasonal insolation may be different from those controlling the response to increasing greenhouse gases. The fact that GCMs have difficulty in simulating the full magnitude of the mid-Holocene wet period, especially in the absence of vegetation feedbacks, may indicate a lack of sensitivity to other kinds of forcing (Jolly et al., 1996; Kutzbach et al., 1996). ... Over West Africa, the number of Regional Climate Model (RCM) investigations is even more limited (Jenkins et al., 2002; Vizy and Cook, 2002). The quality of the 25-year simulation undertaken by Paeth et al. (2005) is encouraging, emphasizing the role of regional SSTs and changes in the land surface in forcing West African rainfall anomalies. Several recent AGCM time-slice simulations focusing on tropical Africa show good simulation of the rainy season (Coppola and Giorgi, 2005; Caminade et al., 2006; Oouchi et al., 2006). \"\n\n11.2.3.1 Mean Temperature : has plots for temp and precip projections over Africa and description of temp projection\n\n11.2.3.2 Mean Precipitation : describes precip projections over Africa including: \"Individual models generate large, but disparate, responses in the Sahel. Two outliers are GFDL/CM2.1, which projects very strong drying in the Sahel and throughout the Sahara, and MIROC3.2\\_midres, which shows a very strong trend towards increased rainfall in the same region (see Supplementary Figure S11.13; and see Table 8.1 for model descriptions). Cook and Vizy (2006) find moderately realistic interannual variability in the Gulf of Guinea and Sahel in both models. While the drying in the GFDL model is extreme within the ensemble, it generates a plausible simulation of 20th-century Sahel rainfall trends (Held et al., 2005; Hoerling et al., 2006) and an empirical downscaling from AOGCMs (Hewitson and Crane, 2006) shows a similar response (see below). More research is needed to understand the variety of modelled precipitation responses in the Sahel and elsewhere in the tropics. Progress is being made in developing new methodologies for this purpose (e.g., Chou and Neelin, 2004; Lintner and Chiang, 2005; Chou et al., 2007), leading to better appreciation of the sources of model differences. Haarsma et al. (2005) describe a plausible mechanism associated with increasing land-ocean temperature contrast and decreasing surface pressures over the Sahara, which contributes to the increase in Sahel precipitation with warming in some models.\n\nIt has been argued (e.g., Paethe and Hense, 2004) that the partial amelioration of the Sahel drought since the 1990s may be a sign of a greenhouse-gas driven increase in rainfall, providing support for those models that moisten the Sahel into the 21st century (e.g., Maynard et al., 2002; Haarsma et al., 2005; Kamga et al., 2005). However, it is premature to take this partial amelioration as evidence of a global warming signature, given the likely influence of internal variability on the inter-hemispheric SST gradients that influence Sahel rainfall, as well as the influence of aerosol variations. \n...\nHewitson and Crane (2006) use empirical downscaling to provide projections for daily precipitation as a function of six GCM simulations. The degree of convergence in the downscaled results for the SRES A2 scenario near the end of the 21st century suggests more commonality in GCM-projected changes in daily circulation, on which the downscaling is based, than in the GCM precipitation responses. Figure 11.3 shows the response of mean JJA monthly total precipitation for station locations across Africa. The ensemble mean of these downscaling results shows increased precipitation in east Africa extending into southern Africa, especially in JJA, strong drying in the core Sahel in JJA with some coastal wetting, and moderate wetting in DJF. There is also drying along the Mediterranean coast, and, in most models, drying in the western portion of southern Africa. The downscaling also shows marked local-scale variation in the projected changes, for example, the contrasting changes in While this result is generally consistent with the underlying GCMs and the composite MMD projections, there is a tendency for greater Sahel drying than in the underlying GCMs, providing further rationale (alongside the large spread in model responses and poor coupled model performance in simulating droughts of the magnitude observed in the 20th century) for viewing with caution the projection for a modest increase in Sahel rainfall in the ensemble mean of the MMD models. the west and east of Madagascar, and on the coastal and inland borders of the Sahel.\"\n\n11.2.3.3 Extremes \"Research on changes in extremes specific to Africa, in either models or observations, is limited. A general increase in the intensity of high-rainfall events, associated in part with the increase in atmospheric water vapour, is expected in Africa, as in other regions. \"\ntable 11.1: has how the extremes are projected to change",

To correct this bias, the authors constructed a new sea surface wind dataset from ship observations of wind speed and wind wave height archived in the International Comprehensive Ocean?Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). The Wave- and Anemometer-based Sea surface Wind (WASWind) dataset is available for wind velocity and scalar speed at monthly resolution on a 4Â° ? 4Â° longitude?latitude grid from 1950 to 2008. It substantially reduces the upward trend in wind speed through height correction for anemometer-measured winds, rejection of spurious Beaufort winds, and use of estimated winds from wind wave height. The reduced global upward trend is smallest among the existing global datasets of in situ observations and comparable with those of reanalysis products. Despite the significant reduction of globally averaged wind speed trend, WASWind features rich spatial structures in trend pattern, making it a valuable dataset for studies of climate changes on regional scales. Not only does the combination of ship winds and wind wave height successfully reproduce major modes of seasonal-to-decadal variability; its trend patterns are also physically consistent with sea level pressure (SLP) measurements. WASWind is in close agreement with wind changes in satellite measurements by the Special Sensor Microwave Imagers (SSM/Is) for the recent two decades. The agreement in trend pattern with such independent observations illustrates the utility of WASWind for climate trend analysis. An application to the South Asian summer monsoon is presented.",

The dominant climatic forcing is represented by predictors selected from large-scale climatic variables provided by the NCEP/NCAR data. Data from six rainfall stations are used in the study to build the models for each station. The extRemes software is used to build the models as it allows parameters of the fitted distribution to vary as a function of covariate(s). The developed models were tested for goodness-of-fit with the observed data, and model fit was found to be much improved when the scale parameter was assumed to vary with the selected covariates. Return level \u2013 return period relations are developed based on the models developed and four future time periods are simulated to investigate the effects of climate change on both precipitation magnitude and frequency. Based on the findings of this research, significant changes in precipitation extremes are projected for Ireland, which includes wetter winters and drier summers, especially in inland areas.",

A Study of Green Libraries and the Role of Public Libraries in the Climate Crisis. Abstract: Introduction. This thesis focuses on the concept of green libraries with the aim to understand how the public library can promote climate action. Since green libraries for long have been absent in Sweden, the study's objective is to examine green libraries in an international context to address what features four German public libraries show that green libraries can fulfill; and in a national context to investigate how green libraries can apply to the Swedish public library's role in society. Method. Semi-structured interviews with librarians at four German green libraries were conducted. The interviews were recorded, and the transcripts was analyzed thematically. In addition to the interviews, the material also con- sists of documents of different genres used to analyze the Swedish perspective. Analysis. The analytical framework uses a theoretical model specially designed to be used in the analysis, called the re-intermediary-model. The model demonstrates the potential of the public library as a social infrastructure in addressing societal issues, such as the issue of climate change. The analysis maps the empirical material and pre- vious research about green libraries to show which library features it fits into. Additionally, the mapped empirical material helps identify the opportunities for green libraries in Sweden. Results. The analysis identifies several areas of interest. The results show that the German green libraries fit into the features of the theoretical model. The libraries' green activities and services function as local meeting places; they inspire users to act with more environmental awareness; green libraries educate about climate change and ways to promote climate action in daily life; and they offer creative spaces to let the users experience sustainability. The results also show that there are many opportunities for green libraries to be applied in Sweden. Many aspects of green libraries and climate action conform to the Swedish Library Act, foremost the legislation requiring mu- nicipalities and county councils to adopt library plans which enables politicians to include climate strategies in the plans and public libraries in local climate strategies. Swedish libraries could devote themselves to conveying knowledge and information about climate change in several ways, for example through urban gardening, media and information literacy, repair cafÃ©s and lectures. Conclusion. Findings reveal that the public library can support civic abilities to participate in climate action. The view of the public library as a space for living and not only a place of books enables the library to convey infor- mation and knowledge through various activities and services. The public library's local connection and inclusive target group give capacity to bring people closer to complex information about climate change, which could benefit climate action and promote community resilience. The thesis also show that Swedish public libraries have a po- tential site for addressing the issue of climate change and promote climate action.",

However, it is unknown how these various systems will respond to such a temperature increase because their relevant spatial scales are much different than those represented by numerical global climate modelsÃ¢\u0080\u0094the standard tool for climate change studies. This deficiency can be addressed by using higher-resolution regional climate models, but at great computational expense. The research presented here seeks to determine how a 2ÃÂ°C global-mean temperature increase might change the frequency of seasonal temperature extremes, both in the United States and around the globe, without necessarily resorting to these computationally-intensive model experiments. Results indicate that in many locations the regional temperature increases that accompany a 2ÃÂ°C increase in global mean temperatures are significantly larger than the interannual-to-decadal variations in seasonal-mean temperatures; in these locations a 2ÃÂ°C global mean temperature increase results in seasonal-mean temperatures that consistently exceed the most extreme values experienced during the second half of the 20th Century. Further, results indicate that many tropical regions, despite having relatively modest overall temperature increases, will have the most substantial increase in number of hot extremes. These results highlight that extremes very well could become the norm, even given the 2ÃÂ°C temperature increase target.",

The rainfall records provide excellent detail for the 20th century. The proxy data have been used to produce a semi-quantitative data set spanning most of the continent and having an annual time resolution. These provide an overview of conditions during the 19th century. Various issues related to the causes of these 2 centuries of variability are also considered: atmospheric and oceanic processes, desertification, surface albedo, mineral dust and hydrological feedbacks. The most significant climatic change that has occurred has been a long-term reduction in rainfall in the semi-arid regions of West Africa. This was on the order of 20 to 40\\% in parts of the Sahel. There have been 3 decades of protracted aridity. Nearly all of Africa has been affected by increased aridity, particularly since the 1980s. Few changes in temperature have been demonstrated. These have occurred on a much smaller scale and are of considerably lower magnitude than those over the continents. The rainfall conditions over Africa during the last 2 to 3 decades are not unprecedented. A similar dry episode prevailed during most of the first half of the 19th century. By mid-century, conditions more typical of the ÅnormalÂ¹ for the current century again prevailed. Thus, the 3 decades of dry conditions evidenced in the Sahel are not in themselves evidence of irreversible global change. On the other hand, the processes controlling rainfall over most of the continent are now reasonably well understood. One of the most important factors, particularly in the Sahel, is sea-surface temperatures. It has been hypothesized that anthropogenic changes in the land surface, particularly land use change and desertification, have contributed significantly to the decline in rainfall. Current evidence suggests that if changes in the land surface (e.g., vegetation cover, surface albedo, soil moisture) signficantly impact climate, they are much more strongly controlled by natural climate variations, such as the recent decline in rainfall, than by human-induced land-use change or degradation. Unfortunately, we still do not have any accurate large-scale assessments of the extent, nature and degree of such changes. The dreaded ÅdesertificationÂ¹ process appears to be confined to relatively small scales. However, there is still cause for concern because the net effect of the various feedback processes involved in land degradation appears to be destabilization of ecosystems. Thus, a priority must be large-scale monitoring of the land surface and estimates of the degree of change.",

Such changes in geographic range could have implications for the conservation and management\nof cetaceans. Here, we propose a bioclimatic envelope modelling approach for providing\nquantitative predictions of how the ranges of cetacean species may respond to changing water\ntemperatures. This combines predictions from habitat niche and \u2018thermal\u2019 niche models for an\nindividual species to determine probable geographic range under specific climatic conditions.\nHowever, if this approach is to be used to inform conservation strategies, it is essential that the\nability to predict responses to environmental change is validated beyond the period of data collection\nused to construct the models. Therefore, in addition to validation of modelled current range,\nwe included a step to validate the models\u2019 ability to predict previous changes in range over time\nin response to climatic changes using independent data. We demonstrate this approach using\ncommon dolphin Delphinus delphis data from the Northeast Atlantic. The combined model was\nconstructed with data collected between 1980 and 2007, and validated using independent distributional\nrecords collected between 1930 and 2006. The validated model was then applied to predict\nfuture range between 2010 and 2069, based on projected water temperatures. Thus, the modelling\napproach is shown to provide the type of information required to help ensure that conservation\nand management strategies remain effective in the face of a changing climate.",

Across temperate regions they include tree species grown as short rotation coppice and intensive forestry (e.g. Populus and Salix species) and C4 grasses such as miscanthus and switchgrass. For bioenergy crops it is paramount that high energy yields are maintained in order to drive the industry to an economic threshold where it has competitive advantage over conventional fossil fuel alternatives. Therefore, in the face of increased planting of these species, globally, there is a pressing need for insight into their responses to predicted changes in climate to ensure these crops are 'climate proofed' in breeding and improvement programmes. In this review, we investigate the physiological responses of bioenergy crops to rising atmospheric CO2 (Ca) and drought, with particular emphasis on the C3Salicaceae trees and C4 grasses. We show that while crop yield is predicted to rise by up to 40\\% in elevated Ca, this is tempered by the effects of water deficit. In response to elevated Ca stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration decline and higher leaf\u2013water potentials are observed. However, whole-plant responses to Ca are often of lower magnitude and may even be positive (increased water use in elevated Ca). We conclude that rising Ca is likely to improve drought tolerance of bioenergy crop species due to improved plant water use, consequently yields in temperate environments may remain high in future climate scenarios.",

Hence, synthetic tropical cyclones provide an alternative to overcome such limitations, improving robust statistics under both present and future climates. We use synthetic events to characterize present and future wave climate associated with tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico. The NCEP/NCAR atmospheric reanalysis and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models NOAA/GFDL CM3 and UK Met Office HADGEM2-ES, were used to derive present and future wave climate under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The GFDL model shows less bias in the present climate with respect to NCEP/NCAR results. Furthermore, the numerical results suggest an increase in wave activity for the future climate in the Caribbean Sea and Northern Gulf of Mexico, whereas some areas are expected to decrease the wave energy, as the stretch of the Gulf of Mexico between Yucatan and Southern Texas. The results have practical implications on the design of offshore structures. The 100-year design wave based on the present climate might result in under/over design of structures, owing to the lifespan of a structure that is within the future wave climate period.

However, uncertainty assessments are open to a range of interpretations, each of which may lead to a different policy recommendation. In the EQUIP project researchers from the UK climate modelling, statistical modelling, and impacts communities worked together on 'end-to-end' uncertainty assessments of climate change and its impacts. Here, we use an experiment in peer review amongst project members to assess variation in the assessment of uncertainties between EQUIP researchers. We find overall agreement on key sources of uncertainty but a large variation in the assessment of the methods used for uncertainty assessment. Results show that communication aimed at specialists makes the methods used harder to assess. There is also evidence of individual bias, which is partially attributable to disciplinary backgrounds. However, varying views on the methods used to quantify uncertainty did not preclude consensus on the consequential results produced using those methods. Based on our analysis, we make recommendations for developing and presenting statements on climate and its impacts. These include the use of a common uncertainty reporting format in order to make assumptions clear; presentation of results in terms of processes and trade-offs rather than only numerical ranges; and reporting multiple assessments of uncertainty in order to elucidate a more complete picture of impacts and their uncertainties. This in turn implies research should be done by teams of people with a range of backgrounds and time for interaction and discussion, with fewer but more comprehensive outputs in which the range of opinions is recorded.",

The index of the North Atlantic Oscillation state is derived from the time series of mean latitudinal position and central pressure of the Icelandic Low and the Azores High considering the synchronous meridional shifting of the two pressure systems. While the North Atlantic Oscillation is characterized by intensive interannual variability, the low-pass filtered index time series shows a decadal component with a time scale of about 50 y within almost 120 y of observation. Since the late 1960s we observe a positive trend and a transition to a strong positive phase of the phenomenon indicative of a pre-dominantly zonal circulation over the North Atlantic. This trend occurs equally in the observations and all examined model data sets with increasing greenhouse-gas-concentration and atmosphere-ocean coupling. We find statistical evidence that the radiative forcing by increasing CO 2 concentration has a significant influence on the simulated variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation on time scales of 60 y and longer, independent of the initial conditions and the model version. The seasonal response is strongest in late summer and winter. The interannual variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation states on time scales less than 10 y decreases synchronously with the positive trend of its decadal-mean state implying a stabilization of its present and future zonal state.",

These foundations have defined climate change primarily as a pollution problem solvable by enacting a price on carbon and by shifting markets in the direction of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency practices. Funding has favored \u201Cinsider\u201D groups that push for policy action by way of negotiation, coalition building, and compromise, rather than \u201Coutsider\u201D groups that specialize in grassroots organizing. Philanthropists have also placed less priority on funding for other low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, or natural gas, nor have they invested in actions intended to boost societal resilience, protect public health, or to address questions of equity and justice. But in the years following the failure of the 2010 Federal cap and trade bill, a review of available grants from 19 major foundations indicates that philanthropists responded to calls for new directions. Funding shifted to focus on state- or municipal-level mitigation and adaptation actions and to the needs of low-income/minority communities. Significant funding was also devoted to mobilizing public opinion and to opposing the fossil fuel industry. Nearly a quarter of all funding, however, remained dedicated to promoting renewable energy and efficiency-related actions with comparatively little funding devoted to other low-carbon energy technologies. The review of past funding trends provides implications for assessing philanthropic strategy during the Donald J. Trump presidency and beyond.

The greening initiative at the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS) Nakuru branch was ranked among the top five applications for the IFLA Green Library Award competition 2017. The green library concept is slowly gaining momentum and recognition in Kenya, as public institutions such as universities and public/community libraries endeavour to construct libraries that meet our next generation of users\u2019 behaviour and expectations. A library building plan must include an environmental impact statement to ensure a low carbon footprint and that improved library services are offered efficiently and effectively (Druaipandi 2016). This paper presents the green library initiatives undertaken by KNLS Nakuru branch in line with the green library movement. These initiatives include the sustainable library building and reading tree initiative in some public primary schools which are members of the library book clubs within Nakuru County. The paper defines the green library/ sustainable library building concept by giving examples and expanding on the reading tree concept as embraced by the Nakuru library. It is hoped that other libraries will embrace the idea and help address environmental problems such as climate change, global warming and air pollution that have adversely affected Kenya and the wider world.",

         "abstract": "The northern Indian Ocean consists by two seas namely the Bay of Bengal in the east side and the Arabian Sea located to the west side. The tropical cyclone activity in the Bay of Bengal is generally higher than that of the Arabian Sea. But new research has been conducted recently showed a drastic shift in this trend of cyclone incidences. In Indian Ocean five Cyclones forms annually in the Bay of Bengal and only one Cyclone develops in the Arabian Sea. But now a days risk scenario is drastically changing, about two years back in May 2020 cyclone Amphan gathered energy from anomalously high sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, intensified and turned into a catastrophic cyclone within a one day. After a span of one week, Nisarga cyclone was formed over the Arabian Sea and struck into western coast of India. The western part of the tropical Indian Ocean has been warming for about a century, at a rate of very high that is faster than any other region of tropical oceans of the World. Tropical Cyclones draw their power from warm waters, which is why they form over warm pool regions where temperatures are more 28 degrees celsius. Tauktae clearly demonstrates the relationship between global warming and cycones origin. The Indian east coast and the coasts of Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka are more vulnerable to the incidence of tropical cyclones of the Bay of Bengal. The tropical cyclones wreak heavy loss of life and property in Bay of Bengal region every year.  The Global climate changes resulting from different type of anthropogenic activities are likely to noticeable itself in the weather and climate of the Bay of Bengal region also.",

For species with northerly or southerly range margins in the North Sea, half have shown boundary shifts with warming, and all but one shifted northward. Species with shifting distributions have faster life cycles and smaller body sizes than nonshifting species. Further temperature rises are likely to have profound impacts on commercial fisheries through continued shifts in distribution and alterations in community interactions.",

However, wind waves have received little attention in global assessments of projected future climate change. We present results from the first community-derived multi-model ensemble of wave-climate projections. We find an agreed projected decrease in annual mean significant wave height (H\\_S) over 25.8\\% of the global ocean area. The area of projected decrease is greater during boreal winter (January\u2013March, mean; 38.5\\% of the global ocean area) than austral winter (July\u2013September, mean; 8.4\\%). A projected increase in annual mean H\\_S is found over 7.1\\% of the global ocean, predominantly in the Southern Ocean, which is greater during austral winter (July\u2013September; 8.8\\%). Increased Southern Ocean wave activity influences a larger proportion of the global ocean as swell propagates northwards into the other ocean basins, observed as an increase in annual mean wave period (T\\_M) over 30.2\\% of the global ocean and associated rotation of the annual mean wave direction (Î¸\\_M). The multi-model ensemble is too limited to systematically sample total uncertainty associated with wave-climate projections. However, variance of wave-climate projections associated with study methodology dominates other sources of uncertainty (for example, climate scenario and model uncertainties).",

Regression techniques are used to derive annual inputs to the water balance, based on lake rainfall data, measured and derived inflows and estimated evaporation during the historical period. This approach acknowledges that runoff is a nonlinear function of lake rainfall. A longer inflow series is produced here which is representative of the whole inflow to the lake, rather than just from individual tributaries. The results show a good simulation of annual lake levels and outflows and capture the high lake level in 1997?1998. Climate change scenarios, from a recent global climate model experiment, are applied to the lake rainfall inflow series and evaporation data to estimate future water balances of the lake. The scenarios produce a potential fall in lake levels by the 2030s horizon, and a rise by the 2080s horizon. A discussion of the application of climate change data to this complex hydrological system is presented.",

Understanding potential changes of cyclone frequency and intensity is thus essential for a proper assessment of climate change impacts. Here the behavior of extratropical cyclones under strongly varying climate conditions is investigated using idealized climate model simulations in an aquaplanet setup. A cyclone tracking algorithm is applied to assess various statistics of cyclone properties such as intensity, size, lifetime, displacement velocity, and deepening rates. In addition, a composite analysis of intense cyclones is performed. In general, the structure of extratropical cyclones in the idealized simulations is very robust, and changes in major cyclone characteristics are relatively small. Median cyclone intensity, measured in terms of minimum sea level pressure and lower-tropospheric relative vorticity, has a maximum in simulations with global mean temperature slightly warmer than present-day Earth, broadly consistent with the behavior of the eddy kinetic energy analyzed in previous studies. Maximum deepening rates along cyclone tracks behave similarly and are in agreement with linear quasigeostrophic growth rates if the effect of latent heat release on the stratification is taken into account. In contrast to moderate cyclones, the relative vorticity of intense cyclones continues to increase with warming to substantially higher temperatures, and this is associated with enhanced lower-tropospheric potential vorticity anomalies likely caused by increased diabatic heating. Moist processes may, therefore, lead to the further strengthening of intense cyclones in warmer climates even if cyclones weaken on average.",

Wind energy density and its interannual variability are estimated based on hourly near-surface wind speeds. Additionally, the possible impact of climatic changes on the energy output of a sample 2.5-MW turbine is discussed. GCM-driven RCM simulations capture the behavior and variability of current wind energy indices, even though some differences exist when compared with reanalysis-driven RCM simulations. Toward the end of the twenty-first century, projections show significant changes of energy density on annual average across Europe that are substantially stronger in seasonal terms. The emergence time of these changes varies from region to region and season to season, but some long-term trends are already statistically significant in the middle of the twenty-first century. Over northern and central Europe, the wind energy potential is projected to increase, particularly in winter and autumn. In contrast, energy potential over southern Europe may experience a decrease in all seasons except for the Aegean Sea. Changes for wind energy output follow the same patterns but are of smaller magnitude. The GCM/RCM model chains project a significant intensification of both interannual and intra-annual variability of energy density over parts of western and central Europe, thus imposing new challenges to a reliable pan-European energy supply in future decades.",

         "pages": "1-22","abstract": "This paper analyzes changes of maximum temperatures in Europe, which are evaluated using two state-of-the-art regional climate models from the EU ENSEMBLES project. Extremes are expressed in terms of return values using a time-dependent generalized extreme value (GEV) model fitted to monthly maxima. Unlike the standard GEV method, this approach allows analyzing return periods at different time scales (monthly, seasonal, annual, etc). The study focuses on the end of the 20th century (1961\u20132000), used as a calibration/validation period, and assesses the changes projected for the period 2061\u20132100 considering the A1B emission scenario. The performance of the regional models is evaluated for each season of the calibration period against the high-resolution gridded E-OBS dataset, showing a similar South-North gradient with larger values over the Mediterranean basin. The inter-RCM changes in the bias pattern with respect to the E-OBS are larger than the bias resulting from a change in the boundary conditions from ERA-40 to ECHAM5 20c3m. The maximum temperature response to increased green house gases, as projected by the A1B scenario, is consistent for both RCMs. Under that scenario, results indicate that the increments for extremes (e.g. 40-year return values) will be two or three times higher than those for the mean seasonal temperatures, particularly during Spring and Summer in Southern Europe.",

         "comment" : "(private-note)p436-7\nÃdvances in our understanding of the complex mechanisms\nresponsible for rainfall variability have been made (see Reason\net al., 2005; Warren et al., 2006; Washington and Preston, 2006;\nChristensen et al., 2007). Understanding how possible climate-\nregime changes (e.g., in El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\nevents) may influence future climate variability is critical in\nAfrica and requires further research. The drying of the Sahel\nregion since the 1970s has, for example, been linked to a positive\ntrend in equatorial Indian Ocean sea-surface temperature (SST),\nwhile ENSO is a significant influence on rainfall at interannual\nscales (Giannini et al., 2003; Christensen et al., 2007). In the\nsame region, the intensity and localisation of the African\nEasterly Jet (AEJ) and the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) also\ninfluence rainfall variability (Nicholson and Grist, 2003), as well\nas SSTs in the Gulf of Guinea (Vizy and Cook, 2001), and a\nrelationship has also been identified between the warm\nMediterranean Sea and abundant rainfall (Rowell, 2003). The\ninfluence of ENSO decadal variations has also been recognised\nin south-west Africa, influenced in part by the North Atlantic\nOscillation (NAO) (Nicholson and Selato, 2000). Changes in the\nways these mechanisms influence regional weather patterns\nhave been identified in southern Africa, where severe droughts\nhave been linked to regional atmospheric-oceanic anomalies\nbefore the 1970s but to ENSO in more recent decades\n(Fauchereau et al., 2003)\n\n\nSeveral studies also have highlighted the importance of\nterrestrial vegetation cover and the associated dynamic\nfeedbacks on the physical climate (see Christensen et al., 2007).\nAn increase in vegetation density, for example, has been\nsuggested to result in a year-round cooling of 0.8Â°C in the\ntropics, including tropical areas of Africa (Bounoua et al., 2000). Complex feedback mechanisms, mainly due to\ndeforestation/land-cover change and changes in atmospheric\ndust loadings, also play a role in climate variability, particularly\nfor drought persistence in the Sahel and its surrounding areas\n(Wang and Eltahir, 2000, 2002; Nicholson, 2001; Semazzi and\nSong, 2001; Prospero and Lamb, 2003; Zeng, 2003). The\ncomplexity of the interactions precludes 'simple interpretations';\nfor instance, the role of human-induced factors (e.g., migration),\ntogether with climate, can contribute to changes in vegetation\nin the Sahel that feed back into the overall physical system in\ncomplex ways (see, e.g., Eklundh and Olsson, 2003; Held et al.,\n2005; Herrmann et al., 2005; Olsson et al., 2005). Mineral dust\nis the largest cause of uncertainty in the radiative forcing of the\nplanet and the key role of the Sahara has long been known.\nBetter quantitative estimates of Saharan dust loadings and\ncontrols on emissions have now emerged from both satellite and\nfield campaigns (e.g., Washington and Todd, 2005; Washington\net al., 2006).\n\np437 Ãne-third of the\npeople in Africa live in drought-prone areas and are vulnerable\nto the impacts of droughts (World Water Forum, 2000). In\nAfrica, for example, several million people regularly suffer\nimpacts from droughts and floods. These impacts are often\nfurther exacerbated by health problems, particularly diarrhoea,\ncholera and malaria (Few et al., 2004). During the mid-1980s\nthe economic losses from droughts totalled several hundred\nmillion U.S. dollars (Tarhule and Lamb, 2003). Droughts have\nmainly affected the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and southern\nAfrica, particularly since the end of the 1960s (see Section 9.6.2;\nRichard et al., 2001; L'HÃ´te et al., 2002; Brooks, 2004;\nChristensen et al., 2007; Trenberth et al., 2007). \"\n\np443 \"Precipitation projections are generally less consistent with\nlarge inter-model ranges for seasonal mean rainfall responses.\nThese inconsistencies are explained partly by the inability of\nGCMs to reproduce the mechanisms responsible for\nprecipitation including, for example, the hydrological cycle\n(Lebel et al., 2000), or to account for orography (Hudson and\nJones, 2002). They are also explained partly by model\nlimitations in simulating the different teleconnections and\nfeedback mechanisms which are responsible for rainfall\nvariability in Africa. Other factors that complicate African\nclimatology include dust aerosol concentrations and sea-surface\ntemperature anomalies, which are particularly important in the\nSahel region (Hulme et al., 2001; Prospero and Lamb, 2003) and\nsouthern Africa (Reason, 2002), deforestation in the equatorial\nregion (Semazzi and Song, 2001; Bounoua et al., 2002), and soil\nmoisture in southern Africa (New et al., 2006). \"\n\np444 \"For the western Sahel (10 to 18Â°N, 17.5Â°W to 20Â°E), there\nare still discrepancies between the models: some projecting a\nsignificant drying (e.g., Hulme et al., 2001; Jenkins et al., 2005)\nand others simulating a progressive wetting with an expansion\nof vegetation into the Sahara (Brovkin, 2002; Maynard et al.,\n2002; Claussen et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004; Haarsma et al.,\n2005; Kamga et al., 2005; Hoerling et al., 2006). Land-use\nchanges and degradation, which are not simulated by some\nmodels, could induce drier conditions (Huntingford et al., 2005;\nKamga et al., 2005). The behaviour of easterly jets and squall\nlines is also critical for predicting the impacts of climate change\non the sub-region, given the potential links between such\nphenomena and the development of the rainy season (Jenkins et\nal., 2002; Nicholson and Grist, 2003).\nFinally, there is still limited information available on extreme\nevents (Christensen et al., 2007), despite frequent reporting of\nsuch events, including their impacts (see Section 9.2.1). A recent\nstudy using four GCMs for the Sahel region (3.75 to 21.25Â°N,\n16.88Â°W to 35.63Â°E) showed that the number of extremely dry\nand wet years will increase during the present century\n(Huntingford et al., 2005). Modelling of global drought\nprojections for the 21st century, based on the SRES A2\nemissions scenario, shows drying for northern Africa that\nappears consistent with the rainfall scenarios outlined above,\nand wetting over central Africa (Burke et al., 2006).\"",

         "abstract": "Predicting whether and how populations will adapt to rapid climate change is a critical goal for evolutionary biology. To examine the genetic basis of fitness and predict adaptive evolution in novel climates with seasonal variation, we grew a diverse panel of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana (multiparent advanced generation intercross lines) in controlled conditions simulating four climates: a present-day reference climate, an increased-temperature climate, a winter-warming only climate, and a poleward-migration climate with increased photoperiod amplitude. In each climate, four successive seasonal cohorts experienced dynamic daily temperature and photoperiod variation over a year. We measured 12 traits and developed a genomic prediction model for fitness evolution in each seasonal environment. This model was used to simulate evolutionary trajectories of the base population over 50 y in each climate, as well as 100-y scenarios of gradual climate change following adaptation to a reference climate. Patterns of plastic and evolutionary fitness response varied across seasons and climates. The increased-temperature climate promoted genetic divergence of subpopulations across seasons, whereas in the winter-warming and poleward-migration climates, seasonal genetic differentiation was reduced. In silico \u201Cresurrection experiments\u201D showed limited evolutionary rescue compared with the plastic response of fitness to seasonal climate change. The genetic basis of adaptation and, consequently, the dynamics of evolutionary change differed qualitatively among scenarios. Populations with fewer founding genotypes and populations with genetic diversity reduced by prior selection adapted less well to novel conditions, demonstrating that adaptation to rapid climate change requires the maintenance of sufficient standing variation.",

The 225 year long daily Central England Temperature record shows no significant increase in very warm days in recent years but there is a marked decrease in the frequency of very cold days. Thus the rise in temperature in the last two decades is principally associated with a reduction in very cold days. Temperatures on days with particular wind circulation or pressure pattern types over the British Isles show multidecadal variations. Analyses using monthly gridded temperature data around the world since 1951 indicate that the recent rise in global surface temperatures is accompanied both by reductions in the areas affected by extremely cool temperatures and by increases in the areas with extremely warm temperatures.",

Here, we report actual maize yields in the Huanghuaihai region over the past 50Â years (1957\u20132007), simulated yields of major varieties in different years (Baimaya in the 1950s, Zhengdan-2 in the 1970s, Yedan-13 in the 1990s, and Zhengdan-958 in the 2000s), and factors that influence yield. The results show that, although each variety change has played a critical role in increasing maize yields, the contribution of variety to yield increase has decreased steadily over the past 50Â years (42.6\\%\u201344.3\\% from the 1950s to the 1970s, 34.4\\%\u201347.2\\% from the 1970s to the 1990s, and 21.0\\%\u201337.6\\% from the 1990s to the 2000s).

Among climatic factors, rainfall had a greater positive influence than light and temperature on yield increase. Cultivation measures could change the contribution rates of variety and climatic conditions. Overall, unless there is a major breakthrough in variety, improving cultivation measures will remain important for increasing future summer maize yields in the Huanghuaihai region.",

However, interpreting climate change projections to better understand the potential impacts of a changing climate on food security outcomes is challenging. This paper addresses this challenge through presenting a framework that enables rapid country-level assessment of vulnerability to food insecurity under a range of climate change and adaptation investment scenarios. The results show that vulnerability to food insecurity is projected to increase under all emissions scenarios, and the geographic distribution of vulnerability is similar to that of the present-day; parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are most severely affected. High levels of adaptation act to off-set these increases; however, only the scenario with the highest level of mitigation combined with high levels of adaptation shows improvements in vulnerability compared to the present-day. The results highlight the dual requirement for mitigation and adaptation to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and to make gains in tackling food insecurity. The approach is an update to the existing Hunger and Climate Vulnerability Index methodology to enable future projections, and the framework presented allows rapid updates to the results as and when new information becomes available, such as updated country-level yield data or climate model output. This approach provides a framework for assessing policy-relevant human food security outcomes for use in long-term climate change and food security planning; the results have been made available on an interactive website for policymakers (www.metoffice.gov.uk/food-insecurity-index).",

We couple the Frankfurt biosphere model (FBM) with a model of the age class development (AGEDYN). The coupled model is applied to simulate the temporal development of carbon pools in German forests under the influence of climate change taking into account changes in the age class structure. In the base case, the growth of forest stands is simulated using a temporally averaged climate data set, being representative for the contemporary climate conditions. To assess the sensitivity of forest growth to changes in environmental conditions, the FBM is run in several scenarios. In these simulations the effects both of climate change and of the direct effect of increased levels of atmospheric CO2\\_on photosynthesis (CO2\\_fertilization) on forest growth are assessed. In another simulation run with the FBM both effects - climate change and CO2\\_fertilization are combined. In simulations under present day's climate conditions a good agreement is gained between simulation results and statistical data of the present standing stock carbon density of Germany's forests. A pure climate change leads to a decrease of the annual increments as well as to the climax standing stocks. The negative effect of climate change alone is overcompensated by enhanced photosynthesis in the simulations with combined climate change and CO2\\_fertilization. In the transient case, the coupled model is used in two scenarios describing first a continuation of present day's climate conditions and second a transient climate change from present conditions (1990) to 2 x CO2\\_conditions in 2090. Here, the simulations indicate that changes in the forest's age class structure can have a stronger influence on the future carbon balance of the forests in the considered region than the combined effect of climate change and CO2\\_fertilization",

         "abstract": "An important aspect of predicting future wildland fire risk is estimating fire weather---weather conducive to the ignition and propagation of fire---under realistic climate change scenarios. Because the majority of area burned occurs on a few days of extreme fire weather, this task should be able to resolve fire weather extremes. In this paper, we present a statistical downscaling procedure based on distribution based scaling (DBS) to bias correct the Fire Weather Index (FWI), part of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, as calculated from modeled climate data. Our study area is western Canada (British Columbia and Alberta) and we consider both an historical control period (1990--2000) and three future time periods (2020--2030, 2050--2060, and 2080--2090). The historical data used to calibrate the DBS procedure comprises weather station data and weather from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), whereas the future climate projections are the output of three regional climate models, corresponding to different model parameterizations and downscaled from the NCAR Community Earth System Model under the RCP 8.5 scenario. By fitting a truncated Weibull distribution to observed and modeled FWI values, our method is able to reproduce historical extremes in fire weather indices as determined by the distribution of annual potential spread days, which are defined as days with FWI values greater than 19. Moreover, by calibrating the DBS procedure with gridded reanalysis data as well as station observations, we are able to project future spread day distributions over the entire study area. The results of this study show the DBS procedure leads to a greater number of projected annual spread days at most locations compared with estimates using the uncorrected model output, and that all three RCM models show positive increases in potential annual spread days for the 2050--2060 and 2080--2090 time periods.",

The reduction of the blocking frequency over the Atlantic and the increased frequency of easterly upper-level flow poleward of 60Â°N are well explained by the changes of mean zonal circulation. In winter and autumn an additional downstream shift of the frequency maximum is simulated. This is also seen in a subset of the CMIP5 models with RCP8.5. To explain this downstream shift requires the inclusion of the changing variance. It is suggested that the increased downstream variance is caused by the stronger, more eastward extending future jet, which promotes Rossby wave breaking and blocking to occur further downstream. The same relation between jet-strength and central-blocking longitude is found in the variability of the current climate.",

Because the impacts are most acutely felt in local communities, it is critical to improve understanding of the response options that are available for and being chosen by communities. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of case studies reporting community-based responses to climate change hazards. Based on content analysis of published case studies, we generated an emergent evidence-based typology of such responses according to their nature and goals. Using this typology, we quantitatively analysed more than 1500 response examples and determined the patterns with which community-level climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation strategies vary across world regions and across economic and governance conditions. Specifically, diversity of responses is lower in developing countries, and implementation of local-level policy and planning responses is less frequent in countries characterised by low governance quality. Our results confirm that, although there is much that local communities can do to respond to the challenges of climate change, there is also a need for increased support of local activities. By synthesising data from many local studies, our research provides a first global evidence base for local-level climate change adaptation policy.",

Southern Africa was delineated into 712 relatively homogeneous climate zones, each with specific climate, soil and vegetation response information. The primary productivity and crop yield models were linked with the climate zones via a cellbased agrohydrologlcal model, with the final output coordinated using a Geographic Information System. The results of this preliminary study show a large dependence of production and crop yield on the intra-seasonal and inter-annual variation of rainfall. The most Important conclusion from the study is the readiness of the developed tool and associated infrastructure for future analysis into social, technological and political responses to food security in southern Africa.",

Using a methodological innovation in network analysis, this paper analyzes discussions about the issue within the US Congress. Through this analysis, the ideological relationships among speakers providing Congressional testimony on the issue of climate change are mapped. For the first time, issue stances of actors are systematically aggregated in order to measure coalitions and consensus among political actors in American climate politics in a relational way. Our findings show how consensus formed around the economic implications of regulating greenhouse gases and the policy instrument that should do the regulating. The paper is separated into three sections. First, we review the ways scholars have looked at climate change policymaking in the United States, paying particular attention to those who have looked at the issue within the US Congress. Next, we present analysis of statements made during Congressional hearings on climate change over a four-year period. Our analysis demonstrates how a polarized ideological actor space in the 109th Congress transforms into a more consensual actor landscape in the 110th Congress, which is significantly less guided by partisan differences. This paper concludes by discussing how these findings help us understand shifting positions within American climate politics and the implications of these findings.",
